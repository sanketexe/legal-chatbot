This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others. During his cross-examination, he has stated that he is a\nresident of Hatia, Chainpur; he has got no property in Kanderbera where\nthe suit property is situated; he was unable to give the Khata number and\nplot number of the suit property ; he had not seen any documents in\nconnection with the property; he could not say the boundary of the property;\nthe rent was being paid with respect to the disputed property, but he has not\nseen the rent receipt; he does not know as to how much paddy is grown on\nthe property, however, he has stated that he used to cultivate the land.\nHe further stated that he had not seen Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knows\nHari Narayan Parikh; he does not know Govindji B. Thakkar. He has also\ndenied having known other family members. He has simply stated that he\nknows Piyush and Prakash. At the time of measurement by Amin, he was\npresent but no document was prepared and he did not sign any document;\nhe has stated that he does not know Jayesh and Hemant and he does not\nknow the name of defendants. He could not say as to by whom and how the\ndisputed property was acquired. He was not able to give the details of the\nneighbourhood of the property. He did not know that the property was\npurchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and whether\nthey used to pay rent to the government. He could not say that after death\nof Manikant G. Thakkar, half portion of the suit property devolved upon his\nsons and daughters. He also could not say that the two daughters and the\n36\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntwo sons of Manikant G. Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined. During cross-\nexamination he stated that he is the resident of Kanderbera and has ancestral\nproperty but could not give the details of his property nor could he give the\ndetails of the disputed property; He stated that he has heard of Khata\nNo.102 but had not seen it; He has stated that he had not seen Manikant G.\nThakkar; the plaintiffs have filed case against the defendants but he does\nnot know their name; Indulal G. Thakkar had expired and he had not seen\nany paper other than the plaint. He has also stated that Yashomati (Plaintiff\nno.1) had told him that he has to go for deposing in the court. He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired. He had not\nseen the father of Manikant G. Thakkar and has no idea as to how many\nbrothers were Manikant G. Thakkar. He is not aware as to how the disputed\nproperty was acquired by Manikant G. Thakkar. He had not been to the\nhouse of Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knew him. He has further stated that\nhe is not aware about the date of partition nor he has seen any document\nnor any partition had taken place in his presence. He is not aware as to\nwhich plot was allotted to whom during partition and the property was\nnever measured in his presence. He could not say that Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas alive and he was defendant no.8. He has stated that it was correct that\ndefendant Rahat Saeed Khan has constructed some house over the property\nand is carrying on business from the said property. He could not say the\ndate and month of construction of the house. The other property sold to\nMithila Motors is being occupied by them. During cross-examination by\ndefendant no.9, he stated that in the disputed property Hari Narayan Parikh\nhad made 8 rooms and was in possession of the same.\n54.   PW-3 is the Plaintiff No. 5, Mr. Piyush I. Thakkar, son of the late\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He has identified the suit land located in Kandarbera,\nThana No. 327, Khata No. 102, with a total area of 17.94 acres. He stated\nthat the Plaintiffs along with Defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and Proforma\nDefendants No. 10, 11, and 12, are all descendants of the late Govindji B.\nThakkar. The Principal Defendants are Defendants No. 5 to 9, who had no\nrelationship with Govindji Thakkar. While giving the genealogy, the said\ndefendant had stated that Govindji Thakkar had four sons, Manikant G.\nThakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar, Mukundlal G. Thakkar, and Chandrakant G.\nThakkar. After death, his property devolved upon his four sons. He stated\nthat on 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, along with one Hari Narayan\nParikh, purchased the suit land through registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n26.09.1959; the property was purchased from the joint family fund of\nManikant G. Thakkar, as he was the Karta of the family; the property was\nmutated jointly in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh; consequently, Manikant G. Thakkar was the owner of the half share\n38\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the property jointly with his three brothers; Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property. He referred to earlier Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982 filed by Hari Narayan Parikh seeking declaration of his right,\ntitle and interest over the entire property covered by the sale deed dated\n26.09.1959; the suit was decreed by the judgment dated 30.05.1992. The\njudgment passed in the said title suit was subject matter of appeal in Title\nAppeal No. 10 of 1992, in which the plaintiffs were also included. He\nfurther stated that in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the wife of Manikant G.\nThakkar and his son Jayesh M. Thakkar deposed that the half share of the\ndisputed property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in family partition.\nThe Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was allowed, and the judgment and decree\nwere set aside, and it was held that Hari Narayan Parikh was entitled only\nto half share of the property. Against the judgment, Hari Narayan Parikh\nfiled Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R), which was also dismissed. He\nasserted that thereafter the plaintiffs continued to remain in possession of\nthe property. He deposed that suddenly in the year 2011, the defendant nos.\n1 and 2 filed application before the Circle Officer for demarcation of land\nupon which the plaintiffs objected, but in spite of that, demarcation was\ndone in Demarcation Case No. 43 of 2011-2012, wherein Hari Narayan\nParikh gave in writing that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year\n1973, the half share of the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in\nfamily arrangement . The order passed in the demarcation case was\nchallenged before the High Court in CWJC No.1354 of 2012, which was\ndismissed against which LPA No. 310 of 2012 was filed, but the same was\nalso dismissed with observation.

Thakkar was made\n43\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nparty in the suit; he is aware that in the suit, half share each was declared in\nfavour of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has denied\nthe suggestion that the descendants of Manikant G. Thakkar did not have\nthe right to sell the property because Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund of all the brothers. He has denied that\nthe plaintiffs were having right, title, interest and possession with respect to\nthe property.\n57.   So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he is Gulab Chandra Manjhi.

Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land.

He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

No. 9      : Mr. Amitabh Prasad, Advocate\n---\nLastly heard on 25/02/2025\n\n14/08.05.2025\n1.    This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar. A number of documentary\nevidences were also exhibited before the learned trial Court which are as\nunder:\n\"Exhibit-1, Legal Notice dated 23.09.2019\n     Exhibit-1/A.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.   The plaintiffs had prayed for the following reliefs: -\n(i) for a declaration of right, title, interest of the plaintiffs over\n         half portion of the schedule 'A' land'.\n(ii) for confirmation of possession of the plaintiff over half\n         portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(iii) for a declaration that the sale deed No. 687 dated\n         06/03/2012 executed by the defendant No. 5 in favour of the\n         defendants No. 6 and 7 registered at Sub Registry office\n         Seraikella is null and void, and did not confer any right in\n         favour of the defendants No. 6 and 7.\n(iv) for a declaration that the sale deed. No. 4324 dated\n         20.10.2012 executed by the defendant No. 8 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9 registered at Sub Registry office Seraikella is\n         null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9.\n(v) for a declaration that the mutation order passed by the C.O.\n         Chandil in mutation case No. 2446/2011-12 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 6 and 7 is illegal and arbitrary.\n(vi) for an injunction restraining the defendants No. 6, 7 and 9\n         not to come over any portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(vii) for cost of the suit.\n(viii) for any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiffs are\n         deemed entitled under the law and equity.\"\n35.   The description of the property involved in this case is as under: -\nSchedule-'A'\n           Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n          Khata No. 102,            Plot No. 559, Area A0.46\n                                    Plot No. 560, Area A01.16\n                                    Plot No. 565, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 563, Area A01.64\n                                    Plot No. 558, Area A02.75\n                                    Plot No. 581, Area A02.89\n                                    Plot No. 586, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 587, AreaA01.41\n                                    Plot No. 562, Area A01.30\n                                    Plot No. 557, Area A00.71\n                                          Total 17.94\n\n\n Schedule-'B' (half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 1 to 4 to\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through power of attorney holder-defendant no.5-\n              covered by sale deed No. 687 dated 06/03/2012 )\n            Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n            Khata No. 102,    Plot No. 563, Area 1.64\n                              Plot No. 565, Area 3.31\n30\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n                              Plot No. 581, Area 2.89\n                              Plot No. 559, Area 0.20\n                              Plot No. 560, Area 0.73\n                              Plot No. 562, Area 0.20\n                                    Total Area 8.97\n\n\n Schedule-'C'(half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 8 to\n  defendant no.9 covered by sale deed.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same.

Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.   The plaintiffs had prayed for the following reliefs: -\n(i) for a declaration of right, title, interest of the plaintiffs over\n         half portion of the schedule 'A' land'.\n(ii) for confirmation of possession of the plaintiff over half\n         portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(iii) for a declaration that the sale deed No. 687 dated\n         06/03/2012 executed by the defendant No. 5 in favour of the\n         defendants No. 6 and 7 registered at Sub Registry office\n         Seraikella is null and void, and did not confer any right in\n         favour of the defendants No. 6 and 7.\n(iv) for a declaration that the sale deed. No. 4324 dated\n         20.10.2012 executed by the defendant No. 8 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9 registered at Sub Registry office Seraikella is\n         null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9.\n(v) for a declaration that the mutation order passed by the C.O.\n         Chandil in mutation case No. 2446/2011-12 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 6 and 7 is illegal and arbitrary.\n(vi) for an injunction restraining the defendants No. 6, 7 and 9\n         not to come over any portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(vii) for cost of the suit.\n(viii) for any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiffs are\n         deemed entitled under the law and equity.\"\n35.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others.

Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined.

He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired.

Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property.

Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\nDuring his cross-examination, he has stated that he has his own land in\nKanderbera. He has no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was the brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land. He has denied that the disputed\nland was being cultivated by Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, his\ndescendants were in possession of the property. He has stated that Sabita\nMahto is the Member of Legislative Assembly (M.L.A.) and at the relevant\npoint of time, her husband Sudhir Mahto was the Deputy Chief Minister of\nthe State of Jharkhand and despite objection by the plaintiffs the property\nwas mutated. He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others. During his cross-examination, he has stated that he is a\nresident of Hatia, Chainpur; he has got no property in Kanderbera where\nthe suit property is situated; he was unable to give the Khata number and\nplot number of the suit property ; he had not seen any documents in\nconnection with the property; he could not say the boundary of the property;\nthe rent was being paid with respect to the disputed property, but he has not\nseen the rent receipt; he does not know as to how much paddy is grown on\nthe property, however, he has stated that he used to cultivate the land.\nHe further stated that he had not seen Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knows\nHari Narayan Parikh; he does not know Govindji B. Thakkar. He has also\ndenied having known other family members. He has simply stated that he\nknows Piyush and Prakash. At the time of measurement by Amin, he was\npresent but no document was prepared and he did not sign any document;\nhe has stated that he does not know Jayesh and Hemant and he does not\nknow the name of defendants. He could not say as to by whom and how the\ndisputed property was acquired. He was not able to give the details of the\nneighbourhood of the property. He did not know that the property was\npurchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and whether\nthey used to pay rent to the government. He could not say that after death\nof Manikant G. Thakkar, half portion of the suit property devolved upon his\nsons and daughters. He also could not say that the two daughters and the\n36\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntwo sons of Manikant G. Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined. During cross-\nexamination he stated that he is the resident of Kanderbera and has ancestral\nproperty but could not give the details of his property nor could he give the\ndetails of the disputed property; He stated that he has heard of Khata\nNo.102 but had not seen it; He has stated that he had not seen Manikant G.\nThakkar; the plaintiffs have filed case against the defendants but he does\nnot know their name; Indulal G. Thakkar had expired and he had not seen\nany paper other than the plaint. He has also stated that Yashomati (Plaintiff\nno.1) had told him that he has to go for deposing in the court. He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired. He had not\nseen the father of Manikant G. Thakkar and has no idea as to how many\nbrothers were Manikant G. Thakkar. He is not aware as to how the disputed\nproperty was acquired by Manikant G. Thakkar. He had not been to the\nhouse of Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knew him. He has further stated that\nhe is not aware about the date of partition nor he has seen any document\nnor any partition had taken place in his presence. He is not aware as to\nwhich plot was allotted to whom during partition and the property was\nnever measured in his presence. He could not say that Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas alive and he was defendant no.8. He has stated that it was correct that\ndefendant Rahat Saeed Khan has constructed some house over the property\nand is carrying on business from the said property. He could not say the\ndate and month of construction of the house. The other property sold to\nMithila Motors is being occupied by them. During cross-examination by\ndefendant no.9, he stated that in the disputed property Hari Narayan Parikh\nhad made 8 rooms and was in possession of the same.\n54.   PW-3 is the Plaintiff No. 5, Mr. Piyush I. Thakkar, son of the late\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He has identified the suit land located in Kandarbera,\nThana No. 327, Khata No. 102, with a total area of 17.94 acres. He stated\nthat the Plaintiffs along with Defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and Proforma\nDefendants No. 10, 11, and 12, are all descendants of the late Govindji B.\nThakkar. The Principal Defendants are Defendants No. 5 to 9, who had no\nrelationship with Govindji Thakkar. While giving the genealogy, the said\ndefendant had stated that Govindji Thakkar had four sons, Manikant G.\nThakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar, Mukundlal G. Thakkar, and Chandrakant G.\nThakkar. After death, his property devolved upon his four sons. He stated\nthat on 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, along with one Hari Narayan\nParikh, purchased the suit land through registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n26.09.1959; the property was purchased from the joint family fund of\nManikant G. Thakkar, as he was the Karta of the family; the property was\nmutated jointly in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh; consequently, Manikant G. Thakkar was the owner of the half share\n38\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the property jointly with his three brothers; Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property. He referred to earlier Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982 filed by Hari Narayan Parikh seeking declaration of his right,\ntitle and interest over the entire property covered by the sale deed dated\n26.09.1959; the suit was decreed by the judgment dated 30.05.1992. The\njudgment passed in the said title suit was subject matter of appeal in Title\nAppeal No. 10 of 1992, in which the plaintiffs were also included. He\nfurther stated that in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the wife of Manikant G.\nThakkar and his son Jayesh M. Thakkar deposed that the half share of the\ndisputed property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in family partition.\nThe Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was allowed, and the judgment and decree\nwere set aside, and it was held that Hari Narayan Parikh was entitled only\nto half share of the property. Against the judgment, Hari Narayan Parikh\nfiled Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R), which was also dismissed. He\nasserted that thereafter the plaintiffs continued to remain in possession of\nthe property. He deposed that suddenly in the year 2011, the defendant nos.\n1 and 2 filed application before the Circle Officer for demarcation of land\nupon which the plaintiffs objected, but in spite of that, demarcation was\ndone in Demarcation Case No. 43 of 2011-2012, wherein Hari Narayan\nParikh gave in writing that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year\n1973, the half share of the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in\nfamily arrangement . The order passed in the demarcation case was\nchallenged before the High Court in CWJC No.1354 of 2012, which was\ndismissed against which LPA No. 310 of 2012 was filed, but the same was\nalso dismissed with observation. It was also deposed that in the month of\nMarch 2012, the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants Nos. 6 and 7\ngot the land mutated in their name on the basis of registered deed No. 687\ndated 06.03.2012, executed through the power of attorney, namely\ndefendant No. 5. It was asserted by P.W. 3 that the land of the plaintiffs was\nwrongly transferred by defendant No. 5, the power of attorney holder of\n39\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndefendant Nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant Nos. 6 and 7. The application\nfor mutation was objected by the plaintiffs, but in spite of that, mutation\nwas allowed against which Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was filed,\nand the matter was remanded back to the Circle Officer.

Thakkar was made\n43\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nparty in the suit; he is aware that in the suit, half share each was declared in\nfavour of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has denied\nthe suggestion that the descendants of Manikant G. Thakkar did not have\nthe right to sell the property because Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund of all the brothers. He has denied that\nthe plaintiffs were having right, title, interest and possession with respect to\nthe property.\n57.   So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he is Gulab Chandra Manjhi.

He has also fully supported the case of the defendants as that of\nD.W. 1 and has confirmed the right, title, interest and possession of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 with respect to the half share of the property which\nwas purchased by Manikant G.

Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land.

He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

The appellant/defendant No. 2 has filed the Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof the C.P.C. challenging the judgment and decree\n           dated 27.01.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,\n2\n(F.T.C.), Balod District - Durg in Civil Appeal No. 08-A/2007, by\n   which learned Additional District Judge, Balod has dismissed the\n   appeal affirming the judgment and decree dated 20.12.1999\n   passed by the Second Civil Judge Class -2, Balod, District - Durg\n   in Civil Suit No. 229-A/98 by which learned Second Civil Judge\n   Class-2 has allowed the suit in part by declaring that plaintiffs\n   after death of Kachra Bai are entitled to get 1/4 th share in the suit\n   property.\n2. The appeal was admitted on 03.07.2020 on the substantial\n   question of law which was further modified on 05.07.2021 and the\n   substantial question of law has been reframed as under :-\n(I) Whether both the Courts below were justified in decreeing\n       the suit by holding that documents Ex.-D/1 and D/2 are\n       inadmissible in evidence under the law for want of registration\n       thereby recorded a perverse finding?\n3. For the sake of convenience, the parties shall be referred to in\n   terms of their status in Civil Suit No. 229-A/98.\n4. The plaint averments, in brief, are that plaintiffs have filed civil suit\n   before the Second Civil Judge, Class II, Balod, District - Durg\n   13.08.1998 for declaration and injunction contending that the suit\n   property situated at village Kharwahi, Tahsil - Gurur bearing\n   Khasra No. 246 area 0.72 R.A. recorded in the name of\n   defendants No. 1 and 2. It has been contended that Plaintiff's\n   father Rambharosa were three brothers namely Kanwali,\n   Bishambhar and Punau. Kachra Bai was wife of Punau. Punau\n   died issue-less on 25.08.1995. Plaintiffs are legal heirs of Kanwali\n   and defendants No. 1 and 2 are legal heirs of Bishambhar.\n   Plaintiffs and defendants No. 1 and 2 are member of the joint\n   Hindu family as such they are governed by\nHindu Succession Act,\n   1956\n. There was no partition with regard to the suit property,\n   therefore, the suit property is in joint possession of plaintiffs as\n   well as defendants No. 1 and 2.          Father of the plaintiffs and\n   defendants No. 1 and 2 have inherited the property from their\n   father and after death of father of the plaintiffs and defendants\n   No. 1 and 2, they have succeeded. Due to death of Punau as he\n   was issueless the property was recorded in the name of Kachra\n   Bai. Kachra Bai also died in the year 1996. Plaintiff left the village\n   for livelihood, but used to come to village for agricultural work.\n3\nWhen the plaintiff No. 1 Rambharosa came to know that Kachra\n   Bai has expired, he went to Revenue Office for deleting the name\n   of Kachra Bai, then he came to know that mutation process is\n   going with regard to suit property before the Tahsildar, Gurur\n   wherein his name was deleted. The plaintiff-Rambharosa raised\n   objection that without his knowledge defendants No. 1 and 2 have\n   deleted his name from revenue record, therefore, he requested\n   that along with name of defendants No. 1 and 2 his name shall\n   also be recorded in the revenue record. The revenue Court has\n   passed the order against the plaintiff Rambharosa on 22.09.1997,\n   against which he preferred an appeal, which has also been\n   rejected. This has caused adverse effect to the interest of the\n   plaintiff, therefore, he has filed the suit. It is further contended that\n   suit property was never divided, therefore, plaintiffs are entitled for\n   ½ share of the suit property. Defendants No. 1 and 2 have illegally\n   taken possession, therefore, it may kindly be declared that they\n   are entitled for ½ share of the suit property.\n5. The defendants No. 1 and 2 filed their written statement denying\n   the allegations made in the plaint contending that with regard to\n   the disputed property partition has already been taken place on\n   20.03.1971 in presence of the Panchayat where father of the\n   plaintiffs had given written consent. The plaintiffs' father had\n   executed an agreement on 13.02.1978 relinquishing his share in\n   favour of the defendants and after selling the share of their\n   property the plaintiffs have no right over the suit property and the\n   suit is not tenable. Since family partition has already been taken\n   place therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to get partition of the\n   suit property as their rights have already been extinguished. This\n   fact is within the knowledge of Kanwali and his legal heirs, as\n   such the suit is not tenable. On the basis of this partition deed,\n   0.47 Ha. of the suit land has also been sold to one Nand Kishore\n   Tiwari by defendants No. 1 and 2 and Late Kachra Bai jointly, as\n   such rest of the property belongs to defendants No. 1 and 2 and\n   Kachra Bai. It has also been contended that plaintiffs have never\n   done agricultural work on the suit property as they are not in\n   possession of the property, whereas, defendants are in\n   possession of the property and doing agricultural work. The\n4\nplaintiffs are well aware of the fact of the case and they have filed\n     the present suit after lapse of 12 years, they have not challenged\n     the right of the defendants, therefore, on account of principle of\n     adverse possession, their rights have been extinguished, and\n     would pray for dismissal of suit.\n6. Defendant No. 3 has filed separate written statement contending\n     that the partition has already been taken place and the plaintiffs\n     have already sold property of their share and have raised false\n     objection before the revenue Court. They have no right over the\n     suit property. Kachra Bai before her death has executed a will in\n     favour of him, as such he is legal heir of Late Kachra Bai,\n     therefore, plaintiffs are not entitled for ½ share of property but\n     defendants 1 and 2 are entitled for ½ of share of the property, and\n     would pray for dismissal of the suit.\n7. On the pleadings of the parties, learned trial Court has framed as\n     many as 7 issues.\n8. The    plaintiffs   to   substantiate    their   case   have   examined\n     Bishambhar as PW/1, Kamal as PW/2, Tulsiram as PW/3,\n     Rambharosa As PW/4 and exhibited documents Certified copy of\n     Sansodhan Panji, as Ex.P/1, Khasra Panchsala of 1977-78 as\n     Ex.P/2 and Order passed by SDO dated 22.06.1995 as Ex.P/3.\n9.   Defendants to substantiate their case have exhibited documents\n     Ex.D/1 Receipt dated 28.03.1971 and Ex. D/2 Ikrarnama dated\n     13.02.1978, Ex.D/3 order dated 22.10.1997 of Tahsildar and\n     Ex.D/4 order of SDO dated 22.06.1995 and examined Jhunni Bai\n     as DW/1, Kanhaiya Lal as DW/2.\n10. The plaintiff witness PW/1 Bishambhar was cross-examined\n     wherein he has admitted that after the death of Kachra Bai,\n     Sukham and Munni Bai are earning from the suit property and this\n     fact is in the knowledge of Rambharosa. He has also admitted\n     that Nandkishore has purchased the property of the Kanwali's\n     family. PW/2 Kamal has also admitted that after the death of\n     Kachra Bai, Sukham and Munni Bai are earning from the suit\n     property. PW/3 Tulsiram has denied the fact that Sukham and\n     Munni Bai are earning from the suit property. He has said that\n     along with Rambharosa they are earning. He has admitted that\n     before the death of Kachra Bai, Rambharosa was living at Durg-\n5\nCharama, Simga. PW/4 Rambharosa has stated that without his\n   knowledge his name was deleted from the revenue record. He\n   has moved an application before the Tahsildar, Gurur which was\n   dismissed. Against that order appeal was also preferred before\n   the SDO, Balod which was also dismissed. He has also admitted\n   that his father had three brothers namely Kanwali, Bishambhar\n   and Punau. Since, Punau was issueless he has additional rights\n   over the suit property. The witness was cross-examined wherein\n   he has denied that his father has given consent with regard to\n   partition. He has admitted that out of the disputed land he has\n   sold some portion to Nand Kishore and he has also admitted that\n   he has utilised this money at the time of his marriage. He has also\n   denied that after marriage he left the place for employment but he\n   used to visit the village. He has admitted that he has not given\n   any application for partition. Kachra Bai, Sukham Bai and Munni\n   Bai were earning from the suit property but he has never objected\n   as his name was there in the revenue record. He has denied that\n   after partition he has sold the property, that is why he has not\n   objected it. He has admitted that for the last 15 years defendants\n   are earning from the suit property. He has denied that his\n   application for mutation has been rejected on the count that he\n   has already received his share on partition.\n11. Defendant No. 1 examined DW/1 Jhunni Bai D/o Bisambhar who\n   has stated that they were earning from the suit property for the\n   last 21 years and 28 years before a family settlement was made,\n   partition was done and Kanwali has mentioned about the family\n   partition which is exhibited as Ex.D/1, the documents were written\n   by the Sarpanch Awadhram. Awadhram expired. But, at the time\n   of documentation Kartikram, Awadhram and other persons were\n   present. She has brought original copy of Ex. D/2 wherein\n   Plaintiffs Bharosa, Pyari Bai, Duleshwar, Bhagwati have executed\n   an agreement of relinquishment of their share in favour of\n   Sukhumat Bai, Munni Bai and Kachra Bai, at that time, Awadhram\n   and Kuntulal Bhoi were also present, but both of them have\n   expired. She has also admitted that Rambharosa has sold 1.15\n   acres of land to Nandkishore of village Kharwahi. After\n   documentation of Ex.D/2 she along with Sukhmat was doing\n6\nagricultural work, which was never objected by any person.\n   Rambharosa has demanded his partition only after the death of\n   Kachra Bai. Manoj S/o Balbhadra has also filed an application\n   before Tahsildar, Gurur in which they have participated and their\n   application was rejected which is Exhibited as Ex. D/3. The order\n   was challenged before SDO, Balod which was also rejected, copy\n   of the order is exhibited as Ex. D/4. She has also admitted that\n   Punau Ram expired prior to Kachra Bai and they are issueless.\n   This witness was cross-examined wherein she has denied that\n   there was no partition between Kanwali, Bisambhar and Punau.\n   She has also denied that at the time of documentation of Ex.D/1\n   Kachra Bai was present. She has denied that Kanwal Ram has\n   not written the relinquishment deed. The dispute with regard to\n   suit property occurred after death of Kachra Bai. Other witness\n   Kanhaiya Lal DW/2 was examined where he has admitted that he\n   was present at the time of partition between the three brothers,\n   but at the time of finalisation he left the place. He has denied that\n   he does not know anything about the partition.\n12. Learned trial court appreciating the evidence, material on record\n   has partly allowed the suit filed by the plaintiffs holding that\n   plaintiffs are entitled for ¼th share of the suit property after the\n   death of Kachra Bai as successor.           Against that judgment\n   defendant Munni Bai has preferred appeal before the first\n   appellate Court under\nSection 96\nof the CPC contending that the\n   judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court is against\n   the materials on record, the learned trial Court has committed\n   illegality in not giving due consideration on the documents Ex. D/1\n   and D/2. The defendants are in possession of the suit property for\n   the last 12 years which was in the knowledge of the plaintiff as\n   such they have acquired the right on principle of adverse\n   possession, still this fact has not been taken into consideration by\n   the learned trial Court, therefore, the judgment and decree\n   deserves to be set aside.\n13. Learned first appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated\n   27.01.2009 dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment and\n   decree passed by the learned trial Court. The first appellate Court\n   has recorded its finding that since the partition has already been\n7\ndone as such subsequent partition cannot be done but the share\n   of Punau which was inherited to Kachra Bai and defendants No. 1\n   and 2 are jointly doing agricultural operation therefore, principle of\n   adverse possession is not applicable. The finding has also been\n   recorded by the First Appellate Court that as per\nSection 14\nof the\n   Hindu Succession Act after death of her husband Kachra Bai has\n   absolute title over the suit property and she has not waived it,\n   died issueless, therefore, this property cannot be inherited by\n   defendants No. 1 and 2 jointly as they are not the only\n   successors. As per\nSection 15\nand\n16\nof the Hindu Succession\n   Act, all the legal heirs are entitled to inherit the property,\n   therefore, the trial Court has rightly passed the judgment and\n   decree and dismissed the appeal. Aggrieved by this judgment and\n   decree passed by the first appellate Court, the defendant No. 2\n   Jhunni Bai has preferred this second appeal.\n14. While admitting the appeal this Court has framed afore stated\n   substantial question of law on 05.07.2021. Even after admitting\n   the appeal, this Court has directed for issuance of notice to the\n   respondents. In pursuance of order, notice was served to\n   respondents No. 2 and 3. Respondent No. 4 and Respondent No.\n   5 unserved as expired. The appellant moved an application for\n   deleting the name of Respondent No. 5 which was allowed by this\n   Court on 04.01.2021. Notice to respondent No. 1 was unserved\n   as he had left the village, therefore, the notice was effected\n   through paper publication vide order dated 04.01.2021 and in\n   pursuance of the order appellant has got published notice in\n   Dainikbhaskar on 06.01.2021 directing the respondent No. 1 to\n   appear on 11.02.2021, despite this service of notice respondents\n   No. 1, 2 and 3 have chosen not to appear before this Court.\n15. Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 would submit that both\n   the Courts below have not appreciated the evidence, materials on\n   record while treating Ex.D1 and Ex.D2 to be inadmissible in\n   evidence ignoring the settled position of law, provisions of the\nRegistration Act\nand\nSection 6\nof the Transfer of Property Act.\n   This is apparent mistake of law as such substantial question of\n   law framed by this court deserves to be answered in favour of the\n   defendants. He would further submit that since through Ex.D1\n8\nand Ex.D2 the plaintiffs have waived their right, therefore, they\n   have no right over the share of the property and the learned court\n   below should have dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiffs.\n16. The controversy raised in this appeal move around the\nSection 17\nof the Registration Act,1908 which provides which document\n   requires compulsory registration and whether Ex.D1 and. Ex.D2\n   fall in this category or not, therefore, it is expedient for this court\n   to extract the\nSection 17\nof the Act which reads as under:-\nSection 17\nin\nThe Registration Act\n, 1908\n17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.--(l) The\n       following documents shall be registered, if the property to\n       which they relate is situate in a district in which, and if they\n       have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No.\n       XVI of 1864, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1866\n, or the\nIndian\n       Registration Act, 1871\n, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1877\n, or\n       this Act came or comes into force, namely:--\n(a) instruments of gift of immovable property;\n(b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or\n       operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether\n       in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether\n       vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and\n       upwards, to or in immovable property;\n(c) non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the\n       receipt or payment of any consideration on account of the\n       creation, declaration, assignment, limitation or extinction of\n       any such right, title or interest; and\n(d) leases of immovable property from year to year, or for any\n       term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\n(e) non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning\n       any decree or order of a Court or any award when such\n       decree or order or award purports or operates to create,\n       declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in\n       future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent,\n       of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in\n       immovable property:\n(2) Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (l) applies to\n--\n(i) any composition deed; or\n(ii) any instrument relating to shares in a joint stock Company,\n       notwithstanding that the assets of such Company consist in\n       whole or in part of immovable property; or\n(iii) any debenture issued by any such Company and not\n       creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing any\n       right, title or interest, to or in immovable property except in so\n       far as it entitles the holder to the security afforded by a\n       registered instrument whereby the Company has mortgaged,\n       conveyed or otherwise transferred the whole or part of its\n       immovable property or any interest therein to trustees upon\n       trust for the benefit of the holders of such debentures; or\n(iv) any endorsement upon or transfer of any debenture\n9\nissued by any such Company; or\n(v) Any document other than the documents specified in sub-\nsection (1A)] not itself creating, declaring, assigning, limiting\n               or extinguishing any right, title or interest of the value of one\n               hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable property, but\n               merely creating a right to obtain another document which will,\n               when executed, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any\n               such right, title or interest; or\n(vi) any decree or order of a Court [except a decree or order\n               expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising\n               immovable property other than that which is the subject-\n               matter of the suit or proceeding; or\n(vii) any grant of immovable property by Government; or\n(viii) any instrument of partition made by a Revenue-Officer; or\n(ix) any order granting a loan or instrument of collateral\n               security granted under the Land Improvement Act, 1871, or\n               the Land Improvement Loans Act, 1883; or\n(x) any order granting a loan under the Agriculturists, Loans\n               Act, 1884, or instrument for securing the repayment of a loan\n               made under that Act; or\n(xi) any endorsement on a mortgage-deed acknowledging the\n               payment of the whole or any part of the mortgage-money, and\n               any other receipt for payment of money due under a mortgage\n               when the receipt does not purport to extinguish the mortgage;\n               or\n(xii) any certificate of sale granted to the purchaser of any\n               property sold by public auction by a Civil or Revenue-Officer.\n(3) Authorities to adopt a son, executed after the 1st day of\n               January, 1872, and not conferred by a will, shall also be\n               registered.\"\nFor better understanding Ex.

Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 would submit that from\n    bare perusal of Ex.D1 it is an unregistered family arrangement\n    and there was corroborative evidence explaining the nature of\n    arrangement arrived at between the parties as mentioned in\n    Ex.D2. he would further submit that conduct of the plaintiffs' father\n    in receiving the money from defendants' father and family in lieu\n    of relinquishment of their interest in family property would clearly\n    show that plaintiffs' father in furtherance of family partition has\n    republished his share through Ikrarnama Ex.D/2. It has been\n    further submitted that oral evidence was also brought on record to\n    this effect, as such it is clearly established that plaintiffs' father\n    has relinquished his share. The learned appellate Court as well\n    as the trial Court have committed material illegality in not giving\n    any consideration to Ex.D1 and Ex.D2. He would further submit\n11\nthat Learned trial Court despite recording a finding with regard to\n           issue No. 3 \"D;k oknh x.k ,oa muds firk }kjk okn Hkwfe dk gd NksM+ laca/kh\n           bdjkj ukek izfroknh dza0 1 ,oa 2 ds i{k esa fu\"ikfnr fd;k x;k Fkk \\ ;fn gka rks\n           izHkkoA that has given a finding that the joint Hindu family property\n           has already been partitioned and plaintiffs have already sold their\n           share but it has not been proved that relinquishment agreement\n           has been executed.\nThe learned trial Court has not given any\n           reason why the relinquishment agreement has not been proved\n           despite ample evidence brought on record. This is perverse\n           finding of the trial Court. He would further submit that the learned\n           first appellate court while examining the validity of the Ex.D1 and\n           Ex. D2 has recorded a finding that Ex.D2 is not registered\n           document, this finding is incorrect application of law as from the\n           bare perusal of Ex. D/1 it is evident that it cannot be construed as\n           document containing term of recital of family arrangement but\n           only memorandum of family arrangement. He would rely upon\n           judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nRavinder Kaur\n           Grewal and Others vs. Manjit Kaur and Others\n1.\nHe would\n           further relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case\n           of\nK. Arumuga Velaiah vs. P.R. Ramasamy and Others\ndecided on 27.01.2022 in Civil Appeal No. 2564 of 2012 and\n           would submit that the judgment passed by the learned trial Court\n           and affirmed by the appellate Court deserves to be set aside.\n18. Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nK. Arumuga Velaiah\n(supra)\n           has held as under :-\n\"18. The following undisputed facts may be noted:-\n(a) The relationship between the parties is not in dispute.\nPeriyaiya Servai through his first wife had begotten the first\n                defendant, P.R. Ramaswamy and through his second wife had\n                two sons, namely, P.R. Kasilingam second defendant and late\n                Marimuthu. The appellantplaintiff is the son of P.R.\n                Kasilingam.\n(b) Appellant has also claimed that his grandfather Periyaiya\n                Servai had executed a will in his favour and therefore he had\n                onefourth share in the suit property.\n(c) It is also not in dispute that O.S. No. 347 of 1991 was filed\n                on the file of the District Munsiff Court, Devakottai by\n1   (2020) 9 SCC 706\n12\nPeriyaiya Servai for declaration of title and permanent\n       injunction, wherein all the suit properties had been shown as\n       joint family properties. Against the dismissal of the said suit a\n       preliminary decree was passed granting onefourth share to\n       the plaintiff therein in A.S. No. 37 of 1993 preferred against\n       the dismissal of the suit.\n(d) In A.S. No. 37 of 1993 it was held that the suit properties\n       were joint family properties and in the year 1964 there was a\n       partition between the members of the joint family. The said\n       judgment was not assailed by any of the parties.\n(e) However, the appellant herein instituted a fresh suit being\n       O.S. No. 101 of 2004 on the file of the District Munsiff Court,\n       Devakottai which was dismissed, against which A.S. No.\n       38/2005 was filed before the Subordinate Judge, Devakottai\n       wherein it was observed that the finding given in A.S. No. 37\n       of 1993 to the effect that there was a partition in the family in\n       the year 1964, had attained finality.\n(f) Aggrieved by the dismissal of the appeal, second appeal\n       being S.A. No. 92 of 2007 was filed before the Madurai Bench\n       of the Madras High Court, which has also dismissed the same\n       by the impugned judgment.\n24. Having regard to the aforesaid provisions of law it can be safely\n    concluded that the said award was a mere arrangement to divide\n    the properties in future by metes and bounds as distinguished\n    from an actual deed of partition under which there is not only a\n    severance of status but also division of joint family properties by\n    metes and bounds in specific properties. Hence it was exempted\n    from registration under\nSection 17 (2) (v)\nof the Act. A document\n    of partition which provides for effectuating a division of properties\n    in future would be exempt from registration under\nsection 17 (2)\n(v). The test in such a case is whether the document itself creates\n    an interest in a specific immovable property or merely creates a\n    right to obtain another document of title. If a document does not\n    by itself create a right or interest in immovable property, but\n    merely creates a right to obtain another document, which will,\n    when executed create a right in the person claiming relief, the\n    former document does not require registration and is accordingly\n    admissible in evidence vide Ranjangam Iyer v. Ranjangam Iyer,\n    AIR 1922 PC 266.\"\n19. From the aforestated legal position and material brought on\n    record it is crystal clear that both the courts below have\n    committed illegality in not considering Ex. D/1 and D/2 as if it is\n    document of partition which provide for effective division of\n    property in future, therefore it is not required to be registered\n    under\nSection 17(2)(V)\nof the Registration Act. Learned Courts\n    below have also not applied the test which is required to see\n13\nwhether the documents shall be registered if the document itself\ndoes not create right of interest over immovable property but\nmerely creates right to obtain other documents when executed\ncreates right to the person claiming relief. Formal document does\nnot require registration, it is admissible in evidence. Ex.D/1 is of\nthe nature of memorandum of understanding, mere agreement for\nsteps to be taken in future for division of property. Therefore, the\nsubstantial question of law framed by this Court is answered in\nfavour of the appellant but learned trial Court while allowing the\nsuit on part has taken into consideration that plaintiff had\namended its pleading and para 6A has been inserted wherein the\nplaintiffs have pleaded that in case if the court finds that partition\nhas been taken place then also they are entitled for half of the\nshare which is share of the deceased Kachra Bai as they are also\nlegal representative of Kachra Bai. The defendants have not\ncontroverted this averment in the written statement. The learned\ntrial Court while recording a finding that Kachra Bai is widow of\nPunau and she was inherited half of the property of her husband\nand as per\nSection 15\nof the Hindu Succession Act property will\nbe inherited by the legal heirs of husband. Since, the plaintiffs and\ndefendants No. 1 and 2 are the legal heirs of the deceased Punau\ntherefore, they are entitled to succeed the property inherited by\nKachra Bai in equal shares. As such, the plaintiffs and defendants\nNo. 1 and 2 are entitled to get 1/4 th share of the property. It is\npertinent to mention here that even Ex.D1 and D2 do not make\nrecital about the partition of the property inherited by Kachra Bai\nafter her death as she was issue less, therefore, the property\ninherited by her will be governed by provisions of\nSection 14\nto\n16\nof the Hindu Succession Act which are extracted below:-\n\"14. Property of a female Hindu to be her absolute property-\n(1) Any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether\n          acquired before or after the commencement of this Act,\n          shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a\n          limited owner. Explanation.--In this sub-section,\n          \"property\" includes both movable and immovable\n          property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or\n          devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or\n          arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person,\n          whether a relative or not, before, at or after her\n14\nmarriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase\n         or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever,\n         and also any such property held by her as stridhana\n         immediately before the commencement of this Act.\n(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any\n         property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any\n         other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil\n         court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will\n         or other instrument or the decree, order or award\n         prescribe a restricted estate in such property.\n15.

Order of succession and manner of distribution among\n   heirs of a female Hindu.--The order of succession among\n   the heirs referred to in\nsection 15\nshall be, and the distribution\n   of the intestates property among those heirs shall take place\n   according to the following rules, namely:--\nRule 1.--Among the heirs specified in sub-section (1) of\nsection 15\n, those in one entry shall be preferred to\n        those in any succeeding entry and those included in the\n        same entry shall take simultaneously.\nRule 2.--If any son or daughter of the intestate had pre-\n        deceased the intestate leaving his or her own children\n        alive at the time of the intestate's death, the children of\n        such son or daughter shall take between them the\n15\nshare which such son or daughter would have taken if\n         living at the intestate's death.\nRule 3.--The devolution of the property of the intestate on\n        the heirs referred to in clauses (b), (d) and (e) of sub-\n        section (1) and in sub-section (2) to\nsection 15\nshall be\n        in the same order and according to the same rules as\n        would have applied if the property had been the father's\n        or the mother's or the husband's as the case may be,\n        and such person had died intestate in respect thereof\n        immediately after the intestate's death.\"\n20. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its recent judgment in case of\nArunachala Gounder (Dead) By Lrs vs Ponnusamy\nin\n   Civil Appeal No. 6659/2011 dated 20.01.2022                  has\n   examined the provisions of\nSection 14\n,\n15\nand\n16\nof the Act.\n   The relevant para is extracted below:-\n\"75. This Court while analysing the provisions of\nSections 15\n&\n16\nof the Act in the case of\nState of Punjab Vs.\n          Balwant Singh & Ors.\n15, has held as under:-\n\"7. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 15\ngroups the heirs of a\n         female intestate into five categories and they are\n         specified under clauses (a) to (e). As per\nSections 16\nRule 1 those in one clause shall be preferred to those in\n         the succeeding clauses and those included in the same\n         clause shall take simultaneously. Sub- section (2) of\nSection 15\nbegins with a non-obstante clause providing\n         that the order of succession is not that prescribed under\n         sub-section (1) of\nSection 15\n. It carves out two\n         exceptions to the general order of succes- sion\n         provided under sub-section (1). The first exception\n         relates to the property inherited by a female Hindu from\n         her father or mother. That property shall devolve, in the\n         absence of any son or daughter of the deceased\n         (including the children of the pre-deceased son or\n         daughter), not upon the other heirs referred to in sub-\n         section (1) in the order specified therein, but upon the\n         heirs of the father. The second exception is in relation to\n         the property inherited by a female Hindu from her\n         husband or from her father-in-law. That property shall\n         devolve, in the absence of any son or daughter of the\n         deceased (including the children of the pre-deceased\n         son or daughter) not upon the other heirs referred to\n         under sub-section (1) in the order specified thereunder\n         but upon the heirs of the husband.\n8. The process of identifying the heirs of the intestate\n         under sub-section (2) of\nSection 15\nhas been explained\n         in\nBhajya v. Gopikabai and Anr.\n[1978] 3 SCR 561.\n         There this Court observed that the rule under which the\n         property of the intestate would devolve is regulated by\n         Rule 3 of\nSection 16\nof the Act.\nRule 3 of Section 16\n16\nprovides that \"the devolution of the property of the\n                        intestate on the heirs referred to in clauses (b), (d) and\n(e) of sub-section (1) and in sub-section (2) of\nSection\n                        15\nshall be in the same order and according to the\n                        same rules as would have applied if the property had\n                        been the father's or the mother's or the husband's as\n                        the case may be, and such person had died intestate in\n                        respect thereof immediately after the intestate's death\".\n76. Again in the case of Bhagat Ram (dead) by LRs. Vs. Teja\n                  Singh (dead) by LRs.16, a two-Judge Bench of this Court\n                  analysing the provisions of\nSections 14\n,\n15\nand\n16\nof the Act\n                  reiterating the view taken in the\nState of Punjab Vs. Balwant\n                  Singh & Ors.(Supra\n), observed as under :-\n\"The source from which she inherits the property is\n                        always important and that would govern the situation.\n                        Otherwise persons who are not even remotely related\n                        to the person who originally held the property would\n                        acquire rights to inherit that property. That would defeat\n                        the intent and purpose of sub-\nSection 2\nof\nSection 15\n,\n                        which gives a special pattern of succession. \"\n21. From the above discussion and considering the law, it is held that\n              finding recorded by the learned trial Court, affirmed by the\n              appellate court to that extent that plaintiffs and defendants are\n              entitled to get 1/4th share is legal, justified and does not call for\n              interference but it is held that the substantial question of law\n              framed by this court is answered in favour of the appellant. Still\n              the appeal deserves to be dismissed for the reason mentioned in\n              the foregoing paragraphs.\n22. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n23. A decree be drawn up accordingly. No order as to costs.\nSd/-\n(Narendra Kumar Vyas)\n                                                              Judge\nDeshmukh",

The fact that\n\n               plaintiff        and   defendants       belong    to     Sunni    Muslim\n\n               Community is not in dispute. It is also not disputed that\n\n               Gulam Moidden Khan died in the year 1978.\n3.          The further pleading is that the property in dispute is\n\n               ancestral property of plaintiff Kutubuddin and defendant\n\n               No.-2/Yakub Khan and Must. Kallo. One                     portion of the\n\n               ancestral house shown in blue lines in the plaint map was\n\n               sold to Smt. Krishna Kumari by Gulam Moiddeen Khan\n\n               father of plaintiff and defendant No. 2 and rest of the\n\n               portion was mortgaged with Kuwar Pratap Singh Chauhan\n\n               on an amount of Rs. 3,500/-. The plaintiff after making\n\n               entire payment had freed the mortgaged property. The\n\n               plaintiff and defendant No. 2 lived together for a period of\n\n               one and half year after the death of their father and\n\n               thereafter started living separately. The              plaintiff is living\n\n               in the southern part of the disputed property at ground floor\n\n               and defendant No. 2/Yakub was living at First Floor of the\n\n               southern part of disputed property.

The\n\n               defendant No. 1 Tahir Khan was living in the southern part\n\n               of the disputed house at ground floor as a tenant and had\n\n               not paid the rent of the tenanted house. The defendant No. 2\n\n               had constructed his own home at Appa Ganj.\n4.          The further pleading is that on 31/07/1985, defendant\n\n               No. 1/Tahir Khan had told to the plaintiff that the disputed\n\n               house, in which, he is living as a tenant was sold to him by\n\n               the defendant No.-2/Yakub for a consideration of an amount\n\n               of Rs. 13,000/- vide registered        sale deed though the fact\n\n               remains that the defendant No. 2 has no right to sale the\n\n               said disputed property to the defendant No. 1 because the\n\n               partition of the disputed property has not been done,\n\n               therefore, the registered sale deed of the said disputed\n\n               property executed by the defendant No. 2 in favour of\n\n               defendant No.-1 is null and void and the same deserves to\n\n               be set aside.\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 7 )-         S.A.

The   defendant    No.-1/Tahir Khan by submitting his\n\n               written statement has denied the averments made in the\n\n               plaint. It is submitted that after partition of the disputed\n\n               property between the plaintiff and           defendant No. 2, the\n\n               property shown in red lines in the plaint map had come in\n\n               share of defendant No.-2/Yakub and on 08/01/1985, he sold\n\n               the property to this defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan which came\n\n               in his share and accordingly that part of the disputed\n\n               property          which   he   purchased   from Yakub   is   in   his\n\n               possession. The defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan had further\n\n               denied that the disputed property was mortgaged with\n\n               Kuwar Pratap and the plaintiff had freed the mortgaged\n\n               property.

It is\n\n               submitted that the partition of the disputed property\n\n               between him and the plaintiff was done and as per the\n\n               partition deed the disputed property shown in the red lines\n\n               in the plaint map has come in his share and he is in\n\n               possession of the same. He has sold the property which\n\n               came in his share to defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan. The\n\n               defendant No.-2 denied that the disputed property was\n\n               mortgaged with Kuwar Pratap and the plaintiff had freed the\n\n               mortgaged property. It was also denied that defendant\n\n               No.1/Tahir Khan was living in the disputed house in the\n\n               capacity of a tenant.\n8.

Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated\n\n               30/08/2003 passed in Civil Suit No. 102A/1998 by learned\n\n               VI Civil Judge, Class-1, District Gwalior, plaintiff has filed\n\n               a Civil Appeal bearing No. 32/2003 before the learned 3 r d\n\n               Additional District Judge, Gwalior. The defendant No. 1 has\n\n               also filed cross objections agrieved by the judgement and\n\n               decree declaring the sale-deed dated 08.01.85 as null and\n\n               void.\n11.

Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the\n\n               learned Additional District Judge has acted illegally in\n\n               dismissing the suit. It is further argued that Tahir Khan had\n\n               instituted a suit for declaration & permanent injunction on\n\n               the basis of the sale deed dated 08.01.1985. In that suit he\n\n               had pleaded that the partition between the brothers (i.e.\n\n               Kutubuddin & Yakub Khan) had taken place and Tahir Khan\n\n               had purchased the portion which was allotted to Yakub\n\n               Khan in the earlier oral partition. The stand of Kutubuddin\n\n               in the earlier suit was similar to the present one meaning\n\n               thereby that no partition had taken place and Yakub Khan\n\n               had no right to sell any specific portion without actual\n\n               partition. The plea of the appellant/Kutubuddin (since dead\n\n               and represented by LRs) found favour and the court of VIII\n\n               ADJ, Gwalior held in its judgment dated 09.08.1996 vide\n\n               Ex P-8 that the partition was not proved and Yakub Khan\n\n               had no right to sell any specific portion of the property.\n\n               This judgment & decree attained finality and is binding on\n\n               the parties on account of the principles of res-judicata.

No. 26 of 2005\nlearned ADJ has committed an illegality in passing the\n\n               impugned judgment without considering the effect of res-\n\n               judicata in the light of Ex P/8.\n13.         The further argument is that the plaintiff has produced\n\n               the municipal record up to the year 1986 vide Ex. P-4, P-5\n\n               & P-6 which goes to show that the suit property continued\n\n               to be recorded in the name of Gulam Moiddeen without\n\n               mention of the alleged oral partition.\n14.         The further submission is that the learned ADJ has\n\n               erred in overlooking the law laid down by the Apex Court in\n\n               the case of\nVidhyadhar vs Manikrao & Anr.\nreported in AIR\n\n               1999 SC 1441 that if the defendant does not choose to\n\n               appear in the witness box it will be deemed that the case of\n\n               the plaintiff is admitted to him. It is further argued that the\n\n               learned ADJ has erred in law in ignoring the settled legal\n\n               proposition that even in case of Muslim Joint Owners, a\n\n               specific portion of the property cannot be transferred by one\n\n               of them without partition. The purchaser has the only\n\n               remedy to restore the possession and institute a suit for\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 12 )-             S.A. No. 26 of 2005\npartition.\n15.         The learned ADJ has further erred in ignoring that the\n\n               registered sale deed dated 08.01.1985 is executed for more\n\n               than the share of defendant No. 2/Yakub.\n16.         It is further argued that        the impugned judgment &\n\n               decree are outcome of non reading and/or misreading of the\n\n               material, oral & documentary evidence on record. Thus, the\n\n               findings         of    the   learned ADJ       have   therefore    become\n\n               incorrect, arbitrary, illegal and perverse.\n17.         On   the     other   hand,      learned   counsel     for   the\n\n               respondents/defendants supported the impugned judgment\n\n               and decree passed by the court below and prayed for\n\n               dismissal of the instant appeal being bereft of merit and\n\n               substance.\n18.

Though, the pleadings regarding earlier judgment passed\n\n               in Civil Suit No. 172/1992 which was decided on 23/12/1992 and its\n\n               effect on the present suit are not necessary to be incorporated and the\n\n               learned court ought to have taken into consideration the effect of the\n\n               judgment contained in Ex. P/8 as the same has legal effect. However,\n\n               learned court below has not taken into consideration Ex. P/8. This\n\n               aspect has came into the notice of the counsel for the appellant on\n\n               23/08/2010, when he was placing final arguments before the Court,\n\n               hence, application for amendment in the plaint is filed because the\n\n               amendment is necessary for final adjudication between the parties.\n\n               Therefore, the amendment mentioned in para 12 of the application be\n\n               allowed to be incorporated in the plaint.

Both the above applications are filed to prove the issue of res-\n\n               judicata. The only reason for inordinate delay of 25 years in filing\n\n               these application is given that when the counsel of appellants was\n\n               preparing the arguments then it comes into notice to him that these\n\n               amendments are necessary and the documents are required to be filed.\n\n               However, the said ground can not be accepted for delay of 25 years.\n\n               The Apex court in the case of\nThe State of Punjab Vs Bua Das\n\n               Kaushal\nAIR 1971 SC 1676 held that Plea of res-judicata\n\n               is not waived if necessary facts were present in the mind of\n\n               parties and gone in to by court absence of specific plea in\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 15 )-             S.A.

Therefore, I.A.No.335/2011 and I.A. No. 334/2011 are hereby\n\n               dismissed.\n23.

It is not disputed between the parties that the property in dispute\n\n               was owned by Gulam Moiddeen Khan who was the father of the\n\n               original plaintiff/ Kutubuddin and defendant No. 2.

Devolution of inheritance :--Subject to the provisions\n                             of\nSections 39\nand\n40\n, the whole estate of a deceased\n                             Mohammedan if he has died intestate, or so much of it as has\n                             not been disposed of by will, if he has left a will (Section\n118), devolves on his heirs at the moment of his death, and\n                             the devolution is not suspended by reason merely of debts\n                             being due from the deceased (k). The heirs succeed to the\n                             estate as tenants-in-common in specific shares (1).\n44. Distribution of estate :--Since the estate devolves on the\n                             heirs at the moment of the death of the deceased, they are at\n                             liberty to divide it at any time after the death of the\n                             deceased. The distribution is not liable to be suspended until\n                             payment of the debts.\n56, Vested inheritance :--A \" vested inheritance\" is the\n                             share which vests in an heir at the moment of the ancestor's\n                             death. If the heir dies before distribution, the share of the\n                             inheritance which has vested in him will pass to such\n                             persons as are his heirs at the time of his death. The shares\n                             therefore are to be determined at each death (y). See\nSection\n                             41\nabove.\"\n29.         Thus the whole estate of a deceased Mohammedan if he has\n\n               died intestate, or so much of it as has not been disposed of by Will, if\nSignature Not Verified\nhe has left a Will, devolves on his heirs at the moment of his death,\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 18 )-              S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nand the devolution is not suspended by reason merely of debts being\n\n               due from the deceased. The heirs succeed to the estate as tenants-in-\n\n               common in specific shares. Unlike Hindu Law, estate of a deceased\n\n               Mohammedan, if he has died intestate, devolves on his heirs at the\n\n               moment of his death. Under the Mohammedan Law, birth right is not\n\n               recognized.\n30.         As per the law relating to succession in Muslims, the right of an\n\n               heir apparent or presumptive comes into existence for the first time on\n\n               the death of the ancestor, and he is not entitled until then to any\n\n               interest in the property to which he would succeed as an heir if he\n\n               survived the ancestor. There is no joint tenancy in Mohammedan law\n\n               and the heirs are only tenants-in-common. Therefore, an heir can\n\n               claim partition in respect of one of the properties held in common\n\n               without seeking partition of all the properties.\n31.         The joint system family or joint property is unknown to Muslim\n\n               law and therefore the right, title and interest in the land held by the\n\n               person stands extinguished and stands vested in other persons. As per\n\n               interpretation by Mulla on\nSec.51\nabout inheritance, there is no\n\nSignature Not distinction\n              Verified    in the Mohammedan Law of inheritance between movable\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 19 )-            S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nor immovable properties or between ancestral and self-acquired\n\n               property. There is no such thing as a Joint Mohammedan family nor\n\n               does the law recognize a tenancy in common in a Mohammedan\n\n               family. In a Mohammedan family there is a presumption that the cash\n\n               and household furniture belong to the husband.\n32.         Mohammedan law does not recognize a joint family as a legal\n\n               entity. In fact according to the rules of Mohammedan law of\n\n               Succession, heir ship does not necessarily go with membership of the\n\n               family. There are several males and females who have no interest in\n\n               the heritage but may be members of the family. On the other hand\n\n               there are several heirs like, for example, married daughters of a\n\n               deceased male owner who take an interest in the estate but are no part\n\n               of the family.\n33.         In Mohammedan Law the doctrine of partial partition is not\n\n               applicable because the heirs are tenants-in-common and the heirs of\n\n               the deceased Muslim succeed to the definite fraction of every part of\n\n               his estate. The share of heirs under Mohammedan Law are definite\n\n               and known before actual partition. Therefore on partition of properties\n\nSignature Not belonging\n              Verified         to a deceased Muslim there is division by metes and\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 20 )-             S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nbounds in accordance with the specific share of each heir being\n\n               already determined by the law.\n34.         In view of the law relating to succession in Muslims as\n\n               discussed above, now it has to be seen whether in the case in hand the\n\n               properties of Moiddeen Khan were partitioned ?\n35.         The plaintiff has examined himself as PW/1 and stated that\n\n               disputed property belonged to his father Gulam Moiddeen Khan who\n\n               died in the year 1978. After his death, he (Kutubuddin Khan) his\n\n               sister Musammat Kallo and brother Yakub Khan became the owner of\n\n               the property. There was no partition of any property in their family\n\n               and, therefore, the defendant No. 2 had no right to sale the suit\n\n               property to defendant No. 1.\n36.         Plaintiff has also examined Nasir Khan (PW-3) in support of his\n\n               case who has supported the statement of plaintiff.\n37.         The statements of plaintiff (PW-1) and Nassir Khan (PW-3)\n\n               remained unchallenged in their detailed cross-examination. In the\n\n               present case, the defendants did not appear in the witness\n\n               box and did not adduce any evidence at all. So, in the\nSignature Not Verified\nabsence\nSigned by: SANJAY\nof rebuttal evidence, there         is no     reason   to\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 21 )-             S.A.

The defendants have also\n\n               not adduced any documentary evidence to prove that the properties of\n\n               late Gulam Moiddeen Khan were ever partitioned. The plaintiff has\n\n               produced the municipal record upto the year 1986 vide Ex.\n\n               P-4, P-5 & P-6 which goes to show that the suit property\n\n               continued to be recorded in the name of Gulam Moiddeen\n\n               without mention of the alleged oral partition. Under these\n\n               circumstances when there is no evidence to prove that the properties\n\n               of Gulam Moiddeen were partitioned, the learned First Appellate\n\n               has committed serious error to hold that the properties of Gulam\n\n               Moiddeen Khan were partitioned between his children and the suit\n\n               property was given to Yakub Khan.\n38.         Learned First Appellate Court has hold that the properties were\n\n               partitioned due to separate living of plaintiff. However, the above\n\n               finding is purely based on the presumption because the separate\n\n               living does not prove the factum of partition in the family. The finding\n\n               of Learned First Appellate Court is also contrary to the provisions of\n\n               Mohammedan Law according to which the share of heirs are definite\n\nSignature Not and    known\n              Verified           before actual partition and on partition of properties\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 22 )-           S.A.

However, in this case the defendants\n\n               have utterly failed to prove the fact of partition in the family of Gulam\n\n               Moiddeen Khan as prescribed in the Mohammedan Law.\n39.         The learned First Appellate Court also ignored to consider\n\n               Exhibit P-8, the earlier judgment passed in Civil Suit No. 172/1992\n\n               which was decided on 23/12/1992 in which the               absence of\n\n               partition was already held between the parties by competent\n\n               civil court and which operates as res-judicata.\nIn the case of\nThe State of Punjab Vs Bua Das Kaushal\nAIR 1971 SC\n\n               1676 held that Plea of res-judicata is not waived if\n\n               necessary facts were present in the mind of parties and gone\n\n               in to by court absence of specific plea in written statement\n\n               and framing of specific issue of waiver is immaterial. In\n\n               this case also the original plaintiff had been cross-examined\n\n               at para 17 of his court statement by the counsel of\n\n               respondent/defendant in respect to earlier Civil Suit No.\nSignature Not 172/1992\nVerified which shows that the necessary facts in respect to earlier\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 23 )-                 S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nsuit were in the mind of parties. The learned trial court also in\n\n               the judgment at para 11 specifically considered Ex. P-8 and\n\n               hold that Ex. P-8 also proved that there was no partition.\n\n               Thus Exhibit P-8 has been in the mind of the learned trial\n\n               court as well. Therefore, Exhibit P-8 is operating as res-\n\n               judicata in this case and in the light of this document i.e.\n\n               Ex. P-8 also it is proved that the properties were not\n\n               partitioned. Consequently, the learned ADJ has erred in law\n\n               in ignoring the settled legal proposition that in case of\n\n               Muslim Joint Owners, a specific portion of the property\n\n               cannot be transferred by one of them without partition.\n40.         As discussed above specific portion of the property\n\n               was sold by the original defendant No.-2/Yakub to Tahir\n\n               Khan whereas Yakub Khan had no right to sell any specific\n\n               portion without the partition by metes and bound. Therefore\n\n               sale-deed dated 08.01.1985 has rightly been declared as null\n\n               and void by the learned trial court.\n41.

But the reading of judgment of learned trial Court\n\n               indicates that the Court has rejected the prayer for recovery\n\n               of possession on various other grounds as well.\n42.         The plaintiff in his Court statement at para 12\n\n               specifically       mentioned    that   Tahir   Khan(the   original\n\n               defendant No.-1) had already left the suit premises and at\n\n               that time the sister of Tahir Khan was living in that portion\n\nSignature Not where\n              Verified      Tahir had been residing.

As per pleadings of plaintiff Tahir Khan was a tenant\n\n               in the suit premises, therefore, he can be evicted as per the\n\n               provisions of\nM.P. Accommodation Control Act\n. The suit\n\n               property is undivided; however, the rest of the co-owner had\n\n               not filed suit for eviction against Tahir Khan. The original\n\n               plaintiff/Kutubuddin, Kallo and defendant No.-2/Yakub\n\n               were the owners of the property after the death of their\n\n               father and partition had not been taken place between them\n\n               and therefore, decree for possession for any specific portion\n\n               can not be given. Therefore, even if the prayer for recovery\n\n               of possession was not time barred in the light of 'doctrine of\n\n               relation back', learned Civil Judge has not erred in\n\n               declining the relief of recovery of possession.\n44.

Ex.   P/8,   the\n\n                           judgment between the same parties is operating as res-\njudicata.\n2.    The amendment allowed in 2002 relates back to\n                           the date of institution of suit; however, learned trial\n                           court has not erred in holding that the plaintiff is not\n                           entitled for relief of possession on other grounds as\n                           discussed above.\n45.

Gupta,A.K.Gupta,S.C.\n \n\n \nHon'ble Mrs. Sunita Agarwal,J.\nBefore going to the matter of merits of the case in view of the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the parties, this Court is constrained to put on record that Sri Ajit Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner was heard at length. He had supplied seven compilations from compilation No. 1 to Compilation No. 7 containing synopsis of the case laws in addition to a written submissions in support of the oral submissions made by him in the Court. This has resulted in making the record too bulky. Each compilation contains number of judgements on each point. For example, in compilation no.2, on the question of consideration of subsequent events, he had referred to ten judgements of this Court and the Supreme Court.\nIn fact one judgement of this Court in the case of\nSaroj Kumari (deceased) and others Vs. Suresh Chand and others\nin  Writ Petition no.8017 of 2003 passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sudhir Agarwal on 20.12.2012 has been referred at two places with two different equivalent citations and by mentioning different paragraph of the same judgement giving an impression that these are two different judgements on the same point. The Court is constrained to record that this approach of the counsel is nothing but an effort either to mislead the Court or to make the record  so bulky as to make it difficult for the Court to decide the matter. Similarly on the point of \"duties of Appellate Court to discuss the reasons assigned by the Trial Court while upsetting its finding and to consider the evidence of the parties\", nineteen judgements of this Court and the Supreme Court have been given in compilation no.4. In compilation no.1, there are fourteen judgements on four different points and in compilation no.7 there are twenty seven judgements on different points. There are two other compilations i.e. compilation nos.3 and 6 which also contain four judgements, thus approximately hundred judgements have been cited by learned counsel for the petitioner in seven compilations supplied by him before oral argument in the matter had started.\nAfter the arguments were over on 05.01.2016, he again passed on a written submission in support of his oral submission citing a number of judgements in various paragraph of the written submissions.\nThis Court may note that the bulky records took lot of precious time of the Court to go through the case laws cited by the counsel and this has caused delay in delivery of the judgement.\nThis Court may further record that after going through the entire pleadings in the writ petition and also the supporting material supplied by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the nature of compilation nos.1 to 7 and written submission dated 05.01.2016 in support of oral submission, the Court would deal with each point argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner but will only refer to those judgements which it think are relevant to deal with the controversy, so as not to make the judgement too long and cumbersome.\nThis writ petition is directed against the judgement and order dated  26.05.2007 passed by Special Judge (E.C. Act), Bareilly in Rent Control Appeal 6 of 2004 (\nNand Kishore Vs. Rajesh Prasad\n). The brief facts of the case relevant to decide the controversy are:-\nThe release application under section 21(1)(a) of U.P. Act No. 13 of 1972 was filed by three brothers namely Nand Kishore, Sundar Lal, Jagdish Saran all sons of Tara Chand residents of Maarwariganj, Bareilly, for release of a godown situated in Marwariganj, Bareilly on the ground of their personal need. The need set up was for three sons of applicant no.1, 2 and 3 namely Sri Vishnu Kumar, Narendra Kumar, Dheeraj Kumar. It was categorically stated in the release application that sons of the applicants had completed their education but they could not settle in their carreer and  they want to establish a new venture for the sale of Empty Tin Cans. As a larger area was required for storage of tin cans, the godown in question was needed. It was stated that for running the business proposed by three younger members of the joint family, only an office space is available  with the landlords.\nThe godown in question exists in a house user of which was of mixed nature. At the first floor, the applicants were residing and at the ground floor a large portion was in the tenancy of the petitioner. It was further stated that the petitioner tenant already possessed a big shop at one side of the godown and the godown in question was not required by him.\nThe release application was contested on the ground that it was defective for non impleadment of the necessary party. The petitioner Rajendra Prasad had wrongly been impleaded as tenant whereas the tenancy was in the name of M/s Satish Tea Company. The application dated 10.10.1995 moved by the petitioner raising issue of maintainability of the release application was rejected vide order dated 14.07.1998 passed by the Prescribed Authority.\nIn support of the release application, the affidavits of Nand Kishore, applicant no.1, Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal, Narendra Mittal son of Nand Kishore, and Dheeraj Kumar son of Jagdish Saran were filed. Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal categorically stated in the affidavit filed on 08.12.1999 that he needed the disputed godown to establish him in an independent business as there was no other place available with him. Shri Dheeraj Mittal also averred in his affidavit that he needed the disputed accommodation for doing business of sale of empty tin Can.\nIn the counter affidavit filed by the tenant Rajendra Prasad, a stand was taken that the release application was malafide, it could not be maintained as M/s Satish Tea Company was the tenant. As the tenant refused to accept the illegal demand of the landlords for enhancement of rent and, therefore, they filed the release application based on a concocted story.  It was further stated that two Daal Mills were being run by the applicants, one Mill manufacturing Bhoora, Kulia was also being run in Bareilly. This apart two other firms namely M/s Ram Swaroop Tara Chand Marwariganj, Bareilly and M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal, Marwariganj, Bareilly were owned by different set of partners being the members of a joint family. The building in question is residential in nature and no commercial activity could be permitted. The applicant's sons were not sitting idle rather they were already engaged in two firms mentioned above. There are other accommodation in possession of the large joint family of the applicants wherein their sons could be accommodated. He also raised a doubt on the willingness shown by the applicants to start a business of sale and purchase of empty tins that too near a residential portion of the family in the building. In the crux, his submission was that the applicants landlord were men of means, they had sufficient sources and place to establish their sons who may also join the joint family business, they had voluminous wealth and none of them were unemployed.\nIn the written statement filed on 13.09.1999 it was stated by the tenant that the landlord had purchased a plot of measuring 800 square yards in Deshmeshnagar, Mohalla Madhobari, Bareilly within the limits of Nagar Nigam, Bareilly. They had recently constructed a shop and godown while the remaining land was lying vacant at the disposal of the landlords. Had the landlords needed the space for business they would not have left the said plot vacant.\nIn replication, it was stated by the applicants-landlords that the property/plot mentioned in paragraph no.9-A of the written statement filed on 13.09.1999 was a property which was purchased by Tara Chand, the applicant's father in the year 1959. There were five co-owners of this property comprising of four sons and five daughters of Tara Chand. In one portion of this property, Smt. Kamlesh Kumari wife of Sri Sushil Kumar had constructed her residential house and was using  another portion being a shop to meet her daily need. It was also stated that the said property was situated at the distance of approximately 1200 meters from the disputed property and moreover, the said area was predominantly residential in nature. It was further stated that the open land could not be used for godown purpose.\nThe petitioner in another affidavit filed on 06.11.2003 reiterated the fact of alternative land of 800 square yard in Deshmeshnagar being in possession of the landlord. The petitioner then moved an application on 14.08.2000 with the prayer to appoint an Amin Commissioner to inspect the properties namely Daal mills, the plot at Deshmeshnagar, the building no. 16, Marwariganj, Bareilly and building No.18, Marwariganj, Bareilly in possession of the landlords and tenants to ascertain the vacant area and the tenanted portion. This application was rejected on 02.09.2000 on the ground that it was moved with a view to delay the disposal of the release matters sufficient evidences were already on record and in view of the affidavits filed by the parties, matter can be decided.\nThe records further indicates that several applications one after the other were moved by the petitioner on different grounds which were finally rejected and the dates 25.03.2004 and 31.03.2004 were fixed for final argument.\nThe Prescribed  authority vide judgement and order dated 16.04.2004 rejected the release application with the reasoning that the applicant's sons namely Dheeraj Kumar, Vishnu Kumar and Narendra Kumar whose need was set up in the release application were found engaged in the joint family business run by the partnership firms namely M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal. It was also recorded that the applicant's family was a joint  family and all in the family were engaged in vast business ventures owned by the family, therefore, the need set up for independent business of three sons was not genuine. On comparative hardship, the affidavit of applicants paper no.76 was considered and rejected on the ground that no documentary evidence was produced in support thereof. The disputed godown was being used by the tenant for his tea business.\nIn appeal, the Court below after consideration of the pleading of the parties and the material on record found that indisputably the applicant's family was a joint family and they had joint business. The contention of the tenant that the need of the members of the joint family had to be determined  looking to the requirement of the joint family and the joint family business which they were already carrying on was also noted. It was discussed that in the firm namely M/s Ram Swaroop Tara Chand, three appellants namely Nand Kishore, Sundar Lal, Jagdish Saran were partners.  In another firm M/s Tara Chand Sunder Lal, Smt. Tara Mani wife of Sundar Lal, Smt. Siromati wife of Nand Kishore and Vivek Kumar son of Nand Kishore were partners. There was one residential accommodation namely house no. 23 Marwariganj, Bareilly. The disputed godown is situated in house no.16, Marwariganj, Bareilly. The ¼ portion of the said house No. 16 was in the share of one brother Ram Gopal who had let out it to one Mangli Ram. The portion which was earlier occupied as PCF godown came in possession of the appellants after release and was being used for residential purposes. At the first floor of the said house no.16 Marwariganj, the family of appellant no.2 was residing and the remaining portion was being used for storage of Daal etc. Fourth property at Dasmeshnagar, Bareilly was an open piece of land which was owned by seven co-sharers and in a portion whereof, residential house had been constructed by one of the co-sharer. Fifth property at 17 Madhobari, Bareilly was an open land of 300 Square meter purchased on 28.06.2001 there existed only gates and a dilapidated building. Sixth property was a shop at Shyamganj which was taken on rent by the appellants for keeping the raw material and manufactured goods of the firm M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal. There was no accommodation suitable for the business proposed by the landlord.\nThe lower appellate Court after having discussed each property in detail came to the conclusion that looking to the  large number of members of the family and the fact that three adult members of the  family want to establish themselves in an independent business and that they filed their affidavits paper no.77-A, 78-A, 79-A, the release application could not have been rejected by the Prescribed Authority on the ground that the applicants sons were engaged in the joint family business. It was also recorded that none of the applicants/sons were partner in the two firms named above. Merely because they were involved/engaged in the family business as a stop gap arrangement their need cannot but be bonafide.\nIt was also recorded that the properties which were in possession of the landlord were not suitable for the business of Tin Can proposed by them. Three adult members of the family were competent to start their business.\nOn comparative hardship, it was recorded that the disputed accommodation was a godown. Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Ram Gulam Gupta Vs. Additional District Judge, Kanpur and others1, it was held by the lower Appellate Court that the godown can be shifted easily at any other place as no goodwill was attached to the building/place. It was also recorded that looking to the pleadings of the parties the tenant would not suffer any hardship in  case, he was asked to leave the godown.\nHaving discussed the release application on both points of bonafide need and comparative hardship it was held that the need set up by the landlords in the release application was not only genuine but pressing. The release application was wrongly rejected by the Prescribed Authority and was liable to be allowed.\nChallenging the release order passed by the lower appellate Court, the submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner are as under:-\n1.\tThe release application has become infructuous as bonafide need set up by the landlord had eclipsed on account of subsequent events taken place during the pendency of the application. The original applicants had died and their sons whose need was set up have engaged themselves in joint family business. Their need to start a new venture of sale of empty tin now does not exist.\n2. Other accommodations are available with the landlord details of which have been given in different paragraphs of the writ petition as well as supplementary affidavit filed before this Court. These alternative premises in possession of the landlords are not denied.\n3.\tM/s Satish Tea Company and wife of the petitioner are the tenants. The petitioner has wrongly been impleaded as tenant.\n4.\tThe tenanted accommodation namely the godown was initially let out at the rent of Rs.4000 per annum but now the rent has been enhanced by this Court to Rs.10,000/- per month i.e. one lac twenty thousand per annum. Thus, on account of said enhancement, the premises has gone out of the purview of the Rent Control Act (U.P. Act No.13 of 1972).\n5.\tThe need set up in the release application was for Narendra Kumar son of application No.1, Vishnu Kumar son of applicant no.2 and Dheeraj Kumar son of applicant no.3, their need has vanished on account of subsequent event of the death of the applicants/landlords.\n6.\tBy means of the supplementary affidavit dated 18.01.2015, the petitioner submitted that a partition has been arrived between the joint family members with regard to the joint family business and the properties owned by joint Hindu family. As a result of the said partition, disputed property namely, the godown situated in house no.18, Marwariganj, Bareilly has fallen in the share of three sons of late Sundar lal namely Vivek Kumar, Vishnu Mittal and Mukesh Mittal. Vivek Kumar has started a firm in October, 2014 in the nomenclature of M/s Sunder Lal Vivek Kumar and running the business of the firm. He has also opened an office and godown in the same building namely house no.16, Marwariganj, Bareilly adjacent to the property in question. He also opened a godown in two big rooms and is running his office in one room relating to Daal mill business in the same building. On the said basis, it is stated that the need of landlords set up in the release application has vanished.\n7.\tSri Vishnu Kumar has never contested the proceeding before this Court, the reply namely the counter affidavit to the writ petition has been filed by Narendra Mittal only on behalf of the respondent no.1 to 4.\n8.\tThe landlords were under obligation to disclose the accommodation in their possession but they had intentionally not done so and this fact would lead to an assumption of non-existence of bonafide need of the landlords.\n9.\tThe question of hardship was to be considered strictly in terms of the provision of section 21 (1) (a) read with Rule 16 of U.P. Act no.13 of 1972 which has not been considered by the Appellate Authority, this fact itself vitiates the order passed by it.\n10.\tThe Rent Control Legislation is for the benefit of the tenant. It is for the landlord to establish his bonafide need which must be real and compelling. If not actual and genuine, the release application needs to be rejected, being a mere desire. Subsequent need cannot be considered.\n11.\tThe Appellate Court without reversing the findings of the trial Court has allowed the release application ignoring the evidence of the petitioner.\nAt the cost of repetition it is noted that in support of these submissions, compilation no.1 to compilation no. 7 have been supplied by the learned counsel for the petitioner wherein more than 100 rulings have been referred on the points noted above. Further in the written submission passed on in support of the oral submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner more than twenty case laws have been mentioned. It is not possible for the court to deal with each judgement on the law point placed by the learned counsel. And further this Court does not find it relevant to discuss each and every case law relied upon by the learned counsel with a view not to burden this judgement. It may also be noteworthy that some of the judgment are not relevant for the facts of the present case.\nNow dealing with the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner.\nFirst submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is regarding applicability of the Act on account of enhancement of rent by this Court, this submission is misconceived in as much as the rent has been enhanced by this Court under an interim order dated 19.07.2007 as a condition to stay the eviction of the petitioner-tenant. The tenant namely the petitioner at the time of hearing on the stay application had offered Rs.10,000/- per month as compensation for the use and occupation of the godown from the month of July, 2007. The petitioner has already been evicted by the Appellate Court, however, the condition put in the interim order to save the petitioner from eviction during the pendency of the writ petition would not mean that the rent of the premises has been enhanced under the provisions of the Act which would result in the premises to go out of the purview of the\nRent Control Act\n' 1972.\nThe second submission is with reference to the events occurred during the pendency of the present petition.\nThe subsequent events which have been brought to the knowledge of the Court is that out of the three applicants/landlords, Sri Nand Kishore, and Sunder lal had expired. They are succeeded by their sons namely Narendra Mittal, Vivek Kumar, Vishnu Mittal, Mukesh Mittal and Smt. Taramani (wife) and daughter Smt. Saroj Agarwal. It is stated that the accommodation in question was required by Vishnu Mittal son of late Shri Sunder Lal, but no counter affidavit has been filed by him till date. The petitioner has brought the subsequent events before this Court by means of supplementary affidavits. In the second supplementary affidavit dated 18.01.2015, it has been stated in paragraph no.4 that the property in question has been settled with Sri Vivek Kumar, Sri Visnhu Mittal, Vishnu Kumar and Sri Mukesh Mittal and thus the counter affidavit of Sri Narendra Mittal who has no concern with the property in question cannot be treated to dispute the averments in the writ petition. Narendra Mittal who has nothing to do with the property in question cannot continue to oppose the writ petition on behalf of all the landlords/respondents. Under\nsection 58\nof the Evidence Act, nothing remains to be adjudicated because the factum of vanishing the need of the landlord is already admitted, in reply to the supplementary affidavits filed by the respondent.\nThe only affidavit filed by Narendra Mittal is neither on behalf of Sundar Lal nor for Jagish Saran nor for Vishnu Mittal and thus is not on behalf of heirs of Sunder Lal. This Court has no option but to dismiss the release application as having become infructuous.\nThe applicants are worthy people having movable and immovable property in abundance, they own highly lucrative business, there is a big building at Marwariganj, Bareilly in which the business under the name and style of M/s Tara Chand Ram Swarup is being run. In another premises at Deshmeshnagar in the city of Bareilly, lot of space is available. One shop at Bazar Shyamganj, Bareilly is also in possession of the landlord. Another mill namely Daal manufacturing mill is being run by Vishnu Kumar son of Sundar lal.\nThus a false story has been set up by the applicants/landlords for unemployment of their sons. The properties, details of which have been given hereinabove are admitted to the landlords. The Prescribed authority after consideration of these materials rightly came to the conclusion that looking to the large joint family business, the need to set up an independent business for sons of the applicants/landlords cannot be accepted. These findings have not been reversed by the Appellate Court. The applicants/landlords did not disclose their business premises in the release application and as such it is a clear case of concealment of material facts. The need, therefore, cannot be termed as bonafide.\nConsidering these submission of learned counsel for the petitioner in the light of the evidence on record, it is relevant to note that the Appellate court has discussed in detail each and every property/business premises owned by the landlords and the business which were being run by them. There is no dispute about the fact that the business which are being run in the family are joint family business. On account of death of their father, the sons whose need has been set up started looking/managing their father's business and are not unemployed as on date. This fact is of no relevance as at the time of filing of the release application they were not engaged in the business or were employed.\nThe settled law is that the crucial date for looking to the need of the landlord is the date of filing of the petition for release. The normal rule is that the rights and obligation of the parties are to be determined as they were when the lis commenced. The only exception is that the Court is not precluded from moulding relief(s) appropriately in consideration of the subsequent events provided such events had an impact on those rights and obligations. Subsequent event may change but only if they are of such nature and dimension so as to completely vanish the need of the landlord, it can be said that the need of the applicant/landlords has eclipsed.\nIn\nRamesh Kumar Vs. Kesho Ram2\n, the then Chief Justice M.N. Venkatachalia, speaking for the bench held that where the subsequent events of fact or law which have a material bearing on the entitlement of the parties to relief or on aspect which bear on the moulding of the relief occur, the Court is not precluded from taking a \"cautious cognizance\" of the subsequent changes of fact and law to mould the  relief.\nIn\nKamleshwar Prasad Vs. Pradumanju Agarwal3\n, the Apex Court has held that even the subsequent events of death of the landlord who wanted to start a business in the tenanted premises is not sufficient to dislodge the bonafide need established by him earlier as the business in question can be carried on by his widow or any other son. It has been held that the subsequent events to over shadow the genuineness of the need must be of such nature and of such a dimension that the need propounded by the petitioning party should have been completely eclipsed by such subsequent events.\nIn paragraph no. 15 of\nGaya Prasad Vs. Pradeep Srivastava4\n, the Court has expressed its concern over long drawn judicial process which create an impact on the rights of the litigating parties. Paragraph no.16 of the said judgement are quoted below;-\n16. Of course a two-Judge Bench (K. Ramaswamy and D.P. \tWadhwa, JJ) pointed out in another case\nAnsuyaben Kantilal \tBhatt vs. Rashiklal Manilal Shah\n[1997 5 SCC 457] that the \tpendency of a lis for a record period of thirty one years has \ttransformed a middle aged landlord to advanced stage of \tgerenry and at that \tstage he could not start a new business \tventure. After lamenting over the system which caused a \twhopping delay of thirty-one years the Bench made two \tdirections. The first was that the son of the landlord who by that \ttime had four and a half years more to go for reaching the \tsuperannuation age could consider starting the business in the \ttenanted premises after retirement. The second was that in the \tmeanwhile the rent for the building would stand enhanced from \tRs.101/- to Rs.3500/- per month.\nIn Ramkubai (Smt) Deceased By Lrs.\nAnd others Vs. Hajarimal Dhokalchand Chandak,5\n, it was noticed by the Apex Court that the landlord was unemployed on the date of filing of the suit but he could not be expected to idle away the time by remaining unemployed till the case is finally decided. It took about 25 years to reach the case at the final stage. Therefore, the contractor work which was taken by the landlord, in the meanwhile, will not militate against the need set up by him for carrying on the business of Kirana.\nIn\nPratap Rai Tanwani and another Vs. Uttam Chand\nand another,6. The Apex Court while considering the contention of the appellant that the landlord's son had taken a temporary employment with Visa for a limited period and went abroad observed that while considering the bonafide need of the landlord the crucial date is the date of the petition. It has observed in paragarph no.7 and 10 as quoted below;-\n7. \tIt is a stark reality that the longer is the life of the litigation the more would be the number of developments sprouting up during the long interregnum. If a young entrepreneur decides to launch a new enterprise and on that ground he or his father seeks eviction of a tenant from the building, the proposed enterprise would not get faded out by subsequent developments during the traditional lengthy \tlongevity of the litigation. His need may get dusted, patina might stick on its surface, nonetheless the need would remain intact. All that is needed is to erase the patina and see the gloss. It is pernicious, and we may say, unjust to shut the door before an applicant just on the eve of his reaching the finale after passing through all the previous \tlevels of the litigation merely on the ground that certain \tdevelopments occurred pendente lite, because the opposite party succeeded in prolonging the matter for such unduly long period.\n10. The judicial tardiness, for which unfortunately our system has acquired notoriety, causes the lis to creep through the line for long long years from the start to the ultimate termini, is a malady afflicting the system. During this long interval many many events are bound to take place which might happen in relation to the parties as well as the subject- matter of the lis. If the cause of action is to be submerged in such subsequent events on account of the malady of the system it shatters the confidence of the litigant, despite the impairment already caused.\nConsidering the law in this regard in the background of the factual matrix of the instant case, it is evident that three sons of the applicants/landlords who were unemployed on the date of release application could not engage themselves in an independent business. Because of death of their father and that there was no other business, they joined the joint family business. Their wish to start an independent business remained a dream. In the release application, specific need of three sons of the applicants/landlords namely Vishnu Kumar @ Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal, Narendra Kumar, son of Nand Kishore and Dheeraj Kumar son of Jagdish Saran was set up. These three sons of the applicants-landlords namely Vishnu Mittal, Narendra Kumar and Dheeraj Mittal had filed their own affidavits before the Prescribed Authority in the year 1999 to state that they needed the shop in question to start an independent business. Sri Narendra Kumar, one of the son of the applicant/landlord filed his affidavit in support of the need set up by the landlords. It cannot be said that since others did not file their independent affidavits before this Court in the present petition, their need had eclipsed.\nMoreover it is settled law that every adult member of the family has a right to start his own independent business. Even for expansion of the family business, the premises can be required. The partition of the joint family property,if any, took place during interregnum, long period of litigation, would again does not frustrate the need of the landlords because there are many members of the family including the respondents herein who can start their business in the disputed accommodation. Even Vishnu Kumar who is stated to have got the disputed property as a result of partition in the joint family is not precluded from starting a new venture. Thus it cannot be accepted that since the applicants/landlords are no more and their sons are carrying on the joint family business for the reason that the godown in question could not be released, the need setup in the release application to start a new venture stood satisfied or eclipsed. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner in this regard are thoroughly misconceived.\nAs far as the contention of the petitioner regarding availability of other accommodations to the landlord and  non-disclosure of the said fact in the release application, it is sufficient to note that non disclosure of all the business premises and all the residential accommodation in occupation of the applicants/landlords  i.e. members of the joint family could not be a factor relevant to reflect upon their bonafide need for the reason that according to the applicants/landlords these premises are not of such nature which would have satisfied their need and further the tenant has not been able to establish that these premises can be utilized by the landlords for the business proposed in the release application. The Appellate Court below has considered in detail each and every accommodations/business premises in possession of the landlords and recorded a categorical finding of fact that they are not sufficient to satisfy the need of the landlords set up in the release application.\nNow the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the appellate Court has not followed the procedure prescribed under law while deciding the appeal in not reversing the findings of the trial Court and the evidence on record has been ignored, its order, therefore, is illegal. To deal with the submission, it is important to note that the proceedings before the Appellate Authority are in the nature of continuation of the release proceeding. The entire evidence on record was examined by the appellate Court and after discussion on each evidence it came to the conclusion that the findings recorded by the trial Court could not be sustained. On comparative hardship a categorical finding has been recorded to the effect that since the disputed accommodation is a godown, it can be shifted elsewhere by the tenant as no good will is attached to the place as in case of retail business. Moreover, the tenant possess ample accommodation in which he can carve out a separate space for the godown. The Comparative hardship was, therefore, tilted in favour of the landlords.\nIt may also be noted that the learned counsel for the petitioner took much time of the Court to place several supplementary affidavits to state that the income from salary and interest from the joint family business in which the applicant's sons are now partner and assets of the landlords are sufficient for their need. Attention of the Court was invited to the income tax returns and other related documents.\nIn this regard it is relevant to note that this Court is not going to review the income of the parties and to examine as to whether their earning is increased during the course of long litigation to hold that their need for starting a new venture is satisfied or not. The only bone of contention of the applicants/landlords was that their sons wanted to start an independent business a new venture. Even to augment the income from the joint family business, in the opinion of the Court, the disputed accommodation can be released.\nMoreover, there is nothing on record that Vishnu Kumar s/o Sundar Lal in whose share this disputed premises came on account of the partition of the joint family property/business could start or has started a new venture as proposed by him at the time of release. As per own case of the tenant he is engaged in the same partnership business which was earlier being run by his ancestors jointly. This fact further substantiate that the need set up in the release application is still alive and the release application cannot be rejected as having became infructuous with the passage of time.\nVishnu Kumar in the affidavit filed before the Prescribed Authority had categorically submitted that he needed the disputed property to start a new business, therefore, it cannot be said that he never came forward to press his need.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has further urged that the release application was itself defective, tenancy was in the name of M/s Satish Tea Company and the petitioner was only a partner. The release application could not have been filed against him as the tenant. It is liable to be rejected for non-joinder of parties.\nThis submission does not appeal to the Court at all for the reason that the petitioner has failed to bring any material on record to prove that the tenancy was in the name  of M/s Satish Chand & Company and further that this plea was not accepted by the trial Court.\nLastly on the question of hardship, it is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that no hardship would be caused to the landlords as the landlord's business would not be affected by not collecting empty tins or keeping them at a different place owned by him. In other words what he suggested is that the proposed business could be run by keeping the empty tins at a different business premises in which other business are being run. Such a suggestion is totally ridiculous.\nFor all above noted reasons, this Court does not find any infirmity in the findings recorded by the appellate Court below and further is of the opinion that the landlords have established their bonafide need for the godown in question and in case the release application is rejected, the landlord would be deprived of starting a new venture which would cause more hardship to him in comparison to the tenant.\nIt is noted that the appellate Court has granted thirty days time to the applicant/petitioner to vacate the disputed accommodation and handover its possession. A condition was also put that the landlord would pay an amount of Rs.8000/- towards two years of rent to the tenant as a consequence of release of the commercial accommodation. The tenant was required to handover vacant peaceful possession of the disputed accommodation to the landlords. As learned counsel for the petitioner did not make a submission for extension of time and as such no further time is being granted to the petitioner. Consequently, the petitioner has to handover peaceful vacant possession of the disputed accommodation namely the godown in question to the landlords within a period of thirty days. Till the date of vacation of the disputed accommodation, up to date rent as fixed by this Court in the interim order dated 19.07.2007 shall be paid by the petitioner to the landlords.\nIn case of non compliance of any of the above conditions, the decree shall become executable forthwith.\nWith the above observations and directions, the writ petition is dismissed.\nOrder Date :- 10.8.2016\n \nHimanshu",

FOR RESPONDENT NO.3)\n\n                                This appeal coming on for admission this day, th e court passed the\n                          following:\n                                                                 ORDER\nThis second appeal has been filed under\nSection 100\nof Code of Civil\n                          Procedure, 1908, against the judgment and decree dated 01.05.2017 passed by\n                          1st Additional District Judge, Amarpatan District-Satna in Civil Appeal No.28-\n                          A/2016, arising out of judgment and decree dated 12.07.2016 passed in civil suit\n                          No.155-A/2016, by Civil Judge, Class I, Amarpatan, District - Satna.\n2.     Briefs facts of the case are that plaintiff filed a suit for declaration of\n                          title and injunction on the ground that in family partition dated 26.02.1970,\n                          plaintiff received disputed property. Hence, they are owner and in possession\n                          of the same. In the instant case, defendants have filed counter claim on the\n                          ground that on 26.02.1970, partition was affected for saving land from ceiling\n                          Act and actual partition had taken place in the year 1980. In 1980 partition,\n                          defendants received suit property. On above ground, defendants filed counter\n                          claim for declaration as well as permanent injunction.\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant submit that on 26.02.1970, partition\n                          was effected between parties for saving land from Ceiling Act and in partition\n                          dated 26.02.1970 land was also allotted in the name of minors. Actual partition\n                          had taken place between the parties in 1980 and it was oral one. In this partition,\n                          disputed property came to the share of defendants. It is also urged that in\n                          proceedings for mutation on the basis of oral partition of 1980, statements of\n                          parties were recorded and in above statements parties admitted partition of\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n3\n1980. These statements are Ex.D/1, D/8, D/12, D/13 and D/14. Trial Court has\n                          discarded above statement on the ground that concerned persons have not been\n                          examined before the Court. Therefore, in absence of their evidence before\n                          Court, statement Ex.D/8, D/12, D/13 and D/14 cannot be relied upon. It is also\n                          urged that Courts below have believed partition on 26.02.1970 whereas with\n                          respect to above partition also no one has been examined whereas parties to the\n                          partition are alive.\n4. Learned counsel for the appellants has urged that during pendency of\n                          trial defendant No.2 expired and on the basis of application filed by plaintiff,\n                          LRs of defendant No.2 were taken on record. Learned First Appellate Court\n                          has wrongly held that defendant's appeal is not maintainable because he did not\n                          implead LRs of defendant No.2 in his counter claim as party.\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that plaintiff has already\n                          impleaded LRs of defendant No.2 in the plaint and counter claim has been filed\n                          against plaintiff. Therefore, he was not required to separately implead LRs in the\n                          counter claim.\nIn this connection, learned counsel for the appellants has relied\n                          upon\nMahabir Prasad Vs. Jage Ram and Others\n, reported in 1971(1) SCC\n265.\n6. Learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that learned First\n                          Appellate Court has wrongly held that defendants appeal is not maintainable as\n\n                          defendants have filed counter claim for declaration and permanent injunction.\n                          But State has not been impleaded as a party as per Order 1 Rule 3(b)\nof CPC\n.\n                          In this connection, learned counsel for the appellants submits that defendants\n                          have filed counter claim only against plaintiff and therefore, he was not required\n                          and it was not possible for him to implead State as party in the plaint. With\n                          respect to above, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to para 13 and\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n4\n14 of Appellate Court judgment.\n7. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that findings recorded by\n                          the First Appellate Court in paras 13 and 14 with respect to non-maintainability\n                          of defendants counter claim for not impleading State as party and for not\n                          bringing on record LRs of defendant No.2 in counter claim are clearly\n                          erroneous. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that substantial questions\n                          of law, arise for determination with respect to finding recorded by Appellate\n                          Court in para 13 and 14. With respect to above, two substantial questions of\n                          law arises for determination. It is also urged that as above two findings are\n                          erroneous. Therefore, appeal be admitted for final hearing.\n8. Heard. Perused record of the case.\n9 . Learned trial Court vide judgment dated 12.07.2016 passed in RCS\n                          No. 155-A/2016 decreed plaintiff's suit and dismissed defendant's counter claim\n                          and appellate Court vide judgment dated 01.05.2017 passed in RCA No.28-\n                          A/16 dismissed defendants appeal and affirmed trial Court findings.\n10. Therefore, question arises as to when this Court can interfere with the\n                          findings of facts arrived at by the first appellate court/trial court. In this\n                          connection, I would like to refer to the law\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Apex\n                          Court in the case of Chandrabhan (Deceased) through Lrs.\nAnd Others vs.\n                          Saraswati and Others\nreported in AIR 2022 SC 4601, wherein Hon'ble\n                          Apex Court in para 33(iii) has held as under:-\n\" 3 3 (iii) The general rule is that the High Court will not\n                                      interfere with findings of facts arrived at by the courts below.\n                                      But it is not an absolute rule. Some of the well - recognized\n                                      exceptions are where (i) the courts below have ignored\n                                      material evidence or acted on no evidence; (ii) the courts have\n                                      drawn wrong inferences from proved facts by applying the law\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n5\nerroneously; or (iii) the courts have wrongly cast the burden of\n                                     proof. When we refer to \"decision\" based on no evidence\", it\n                                     not only refers to cases where there is a total dearth of\n                                     evidence, but also refers to any case, where the evidence,\n                                     taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the\n                                     finding.\"\n11. Similarly in the case of Gurnam Singh (Dead) by legal\n                          representatives and\nOthers vs. Lehna Singh (Dead\n) by legal representatives,\n                          Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-\n\"13.1.......However, in Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof\n                                     the CPC, the High Court, by impugned judgment and order has\n                                     interfered with the Judgment and Decree passed by the First\n                                     Appellate Court. While interfering with the judgment and order\n                                     passed by the first Appellate Court, it appears that while\n                                     upsetting the judgment and decree passed by the First\n                                     Appellate Court, the High Court has again appreciated the\n                                     entire evidence on record, which in exercise of powers under\nSection 100\nCPC is not permissible. While passing the\n                                     impugned judgment and order, it appears that High Court has\n                                     not at all appreciated the fact that the High Court was deciding\n                                     the Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof the CPC and not first\n                                     appeal under\nSection 96\nof the CPC. As per the law\nlaid down\n                                     by\nthis Court in a catena of decisions, the jurisdiction of High\n                                     Court to entertain second appeal under\nSection 100\nCPC after\n                                     the 1976 Amendment, is confined only when the second appeal\n                                     involves a substantial question of law. The existence of 'a\n                                     substantial question of law' is a sine qua non for the exercise\n                                     of the jurisdiction under\nSection 100\nof the CPC.\nAs observed\n                                     and held by this Court in the case of Kondiba Dagadu Kadam\n                                     (Supra), in a second appeal under\nSection 100\nof the CPC, the\n                                     High Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the\n                                     First Appellate Court, unless it finds that the conclusions\n                                     drawn by the lower Court were erroneous being:\n(i) Contrary to the mandatory provisions\n                                              of the applicable law; OR\n(ii) Contrary to the law as pronounced by\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n6\nthe Apex Court; OR\n(iii) Based on inadmissible evidence or no\n                                      evidence\n                                   It is further observed by this Court in the aforesaid decision that\n                                  if First Appellate Court has exercised its discretion in a judicial\n                                  manner, its decision cannot be recorded as suffering from an\n                                  error either of law or of procedure requiring interference in\n                                  second appeal. It is further observed that the Trial Court could\n                                  have decided differently is not a question of law justifying\n                                  interference in second appeal\".\n12.\nIn this connection, Ishwar Dass Jain (Dead) through\nLrs vs. Sohan\n                          Lal (Dead) by LRs\nreported in (2000) 1 Supreme Court Cases 434 may also be\n                          referred to. Paras 11 and 12 of\nthe said judgment\nis relevant and is under:-\n\"11. There are two situations in which interference with\n                                      findings of fact is permissible. The first one is when material\n                                      or relevant evidence is not considered which, if considered\n                                      would have led to an opposite conclusion. This principle has\n                                      been\nlaid down in\na series of judgments of this Court in\n                                      relation to\nsection 100\nCPC after the 1976 amendment.\nIn\nDilbagrai Punjabi vs. Sharad Chandra\n[1988 Supple. SCC\n                                      710], while dealing with a Second Appeal of 1978 decided by\n                                      the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 20.8.81, L.M.Sharma, J.(as\n                                      he then was) observed that \"The Court (the first appellate\n                                      Court) is under a duty to examine the entire relevant evidence\n                                      on record and if it refuses to consider important evidence\n                                      having direct bearing on the disputed issue and the error which\n                                      arises as of a magnitude that it gives birth to a substantial\n                                      question of law, the High Court is fully authorised to set aside\n                                      the finding. This is the situation in the present case.\"\nIn that case, an admission by the defendant-tenant in the\n                                      reply notice in regard to the plaintiff's title and the description\n                                      of the plaintiff as `owner' of the property signed by the\n                                      defendant were not considered by the first appellate Court\n                                      while holding that the plaintiff had not proved his title. The\n                                      High Court interfered with the finding on the ground of non-\n                                      consideration of vital evidence and this Court affirmed\nthe said\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n7\ndecision\n. That was upheld.\nIn\nJagdish Singh vs. Nathu Singh\n[1992 (1) SCC 647], with reference to a Second Appeal of\n                                     1978 disposed of on 5.4.1991. Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then\n                                     was) held:\n\"where the findings by the Court of facts is vitiated by non-\n                                     consideration of relevant evidence or by an essentially\n                                     erroneous approach to the matter, the High Court is not\n                                     precluded from recording proper findings.\"\nAgain in\nSundra Naicka Vadiyar vs. Ramaswami Ayyar\n[1995 Suppl. (4) SCC 534], it was held that where certain\n                                     vital documents for deciding the question of possession were\n                                     ignored - such as a compromise, an order of the revenue Court\n- reliance on oral evidence was unjustified.\nIn yet another case\n                                     in\nMehrunissa vs. Visham Kumari\n[1998 (2) SCC 295] arising\n                                     out of Second appeal of 1988 decided on 15.1.1996, it was\n                                     held by Venkataswami, J. that a finding arrived at by ignoring\n                                     the second notice issued by the landlady and without noticing\n                                     that the suit was not based on earlier notices, was vitiated\n                                     finding. This was in Second Appeal of 1988 decided on\n                                     15.1.1996.\n12. The second situation in which interference with findings of\n                                     fact is permissible is where a finding has been arrived at by\n                                     the appellate Court by placing reliance on inadmissible\n                                     evidence which if it was omitted, an opposite conclusion was\n                                     possible.\nIn\nSri Chand Gupta vs. Gulzar Singh\n[1992 (1) SCC\n                                     143], it was held that the High Court was right in interfering in\n                                     Second Appeal where the lower appellate Court relied upon\n                                     an admission of a third party treating it as binding on the\n                                     defendant. The admission was inadmissible as against the\n                                     defendant. This was also a Second Appeal of 1981 disposed\n                                     of on 24.9.1985\".\n13. It is correct that Appellate Court in paras 13, 14 and 15 has held that\n                          on account of non-compliance of provision contained in Order 1 Rule 3(b)\nof\n                          CPC\n, counter claim filed by defendant is not maintainable. Further, it also held\n                          that defendants have not impleaded LRs of deceased defendant Ramsiya in\n                          counter claim. On above grounds, Appellate Court held that counter claim is\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n8\nnot maintainable.\n14. Before discussing above aspect of the matter, it would be appropriate\n                          to discuss the case on merits, as Appellate Court has dismissed defendant's\n                          counter claim on merits also and it is evident from judgement passed by First\n                          Appellate Court.\n15. Basis of defendant's counter claim is that partition dated 26.02.1970\n                          was effected between the parties just to save land from ceiling Act and actual\n                          partition took place between the parties in the year 1980.\n16. Thus, it is an admitted fact that        written partition (Ex.P/1) was\n                          effected on 26.02.1970 between the parties. Hence, no statement in Court of\n                          any witness/party required to prove the same. Therefore, questions arises as to\n                          whether any other partition took place between the parties in the year 1980. As\n                          per submissions for learned counsel for the appellant oral partition was effected\n                          between the parties in the year 1980.\n17. Perusal of the record reveals that defendants have not filed any\n                          documents, pertaining to mutation proceedings, which might have been initiated\n                          on the basis of oral partition in the year 1980. Further, defendants have also not\n                          filed any application which might have been filed before competent revenue\n                          Court for mutation in accordance with oral partition. No record of mutation, if\n                          any initiated on the basis of oral partition in the year 1980, has been filed in the\n                          case on behalf of defendants.\n18. Further, no revenue record (khasra panchshala) etc. has been filed on\n                          behalf of defendants, in which entry might have been made on the basis of\n                          order passed in pursuance of oral partition in the year 1980. Ex.D/8, D/12, D/13\n                          and D/14 are panchnama's and not statements of witnesses.\n19. I have also one through the evidence on record, in this Court's\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n9\nconsidered opinion, if evidence on record is read and assessed conjointly, then,\n                          from evidence on record, it is not established at all that any oral partition took\n                          place between the parties in the year 1980. Hence, even if it is held that\n                          defendant's counter claim is maintainable, still, then, no decree can be passed in\n                          favour of defendant.\n20. Hence, in this Court's considered opinion, no substantial questions of\n                          law, especially 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, as mentioned in appeal memo, arises for\n                          determination of this Court and no fruitful purpose would be served by\n                          admitting this appeal on proposed substantial questions of law (5.2, 5.3 and\n                          5.4) in appeal memo, it is also so because Appellate Court as well as trial Court\n                          has dismissed defendant's counter claim on merits also. Therefore, principle law\nlaid down in\nMahabir Prasad\n(supra) does not help appellants in any way.\n21. If pleadings and evidence adduced by the parties and the impugned\n                          judgment passed by the first appellate court/trial court is considered, in the\n                          light of above legal principles/legal provisions reiterated in aforesaid judgments,\n                          then, in this Court's considered opinion, the findings of facts recorded by the\n                          first appellate court/trial court are not liable to be interfered with in the\n                          instant case and it cannot be said that first appellate court/trial court has\n                          ignored any material evidence or has acted on no evidence or first appellate\n                          court/trial court has drawn wrong inferences from the proved facts etc.\n                          Further, it cannot be said that evidence taken as a whole, is not reasonably\n                          capable of supporting the findings. It can also be not said that the findings of\n                          first appellate court/trial court are based on inadmissible evidence.\n22. A perusal of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the first\n                          appellate court/trial court reveals that it is well reasoned and has been passed\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n10\nafter due consideration of oral as well as documentary evidence on record.\n                          Learned counsel for the appellant has failed to show that how the findings of\n                          facts recorded by the first appellate court/trial court are illegal, perverse and\n                          based on no evidence etc. The learned first appellate court/trial court has\n                          legally and rightly dealt with the issues involved in the matter and has recorded\n                          correct findings of fact.\n23. For the reasons aforesaid, I find no merit in the instant second\n                          appeal. Findings recorded by the first appellate court/trial court are fully\n                          justified by the evidence on record. Findings recorded by the first appellate\n                          court/trial court are not based on misreading or mis-appreciation of evidence\n                          nor it is shown to be illegal or perverse in any manner so as to call for\n                          interference in second appeal. No question of law, much less substantial\n                          question of law, arises for adjudication in the instant appeal. Hence, appeal is\n                          dismissed in limine.\n24. A copy of this order along with record be sent back to the first\n                          appellate court/trial court for information and its compliance.\n(ACHAL KUMAR PALIWAL)\n                                                                                  JUDGE\n                          sm\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM",

Heard Ms. Rama Goel Bansal learned counsel for appellant and Sri Iqbal Ahmad for respondent.\n2. This appeal under Section 96 of Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to as\nCPC\n) has come up at the instance of defendant assailing judgment and decree dated 13.02.2004 and 26.02.2004 passed by Sri N.A. Zaidi, Additional District Judge, Court no. 4, Moradabad decreeing Original Suit no. 43 of 2003 granting permanent injunction against defendant appellant restraining from interfering in property in dispute which was in possession of plaintiff.\n3. The plaintiff Satendra Kumar Singh instituted Original Suit no. 43 of 2003 impleading Sri Amolak Singh defendant appellant as sole defendant setting up his case that property dated at the bottom of plaint was owned by late Ram Rakshpal Singh father of plaintiff in view of gift deed dated 22.02.1954 executed by Kunwar Jagannath Singh. Plaintiff's father Ram Rakshpal Singh died on 23.09.1996 leaving his widow, five sons and three daughters as legal heirs. At the time of filing suit, widow of Ram Rakshpal Singh and two sons had also died. Both these sons were unmarried at the time of death.  Three daughters of Ram Rakshpal Singh had married and were staying with in-laws, outside Moradabad City. Plaintiffs' two other elder brothers with their family were residing at Varanasi and Haridwar. In the disputed house, plaintiff was residing along with his family and in some part thereof tenants were occupying the premises. No partition in respect to disputed property, owned earlier by late Ram Rakshpal Singh, has taken place between his legal heirs and entire property therefore, was in joint ownership of plaintiff and his brothers and sisters.\n4. Defendant-appellant Amalok Singh was engaged in business of Real Estate and wants to purchase plaintiff's property under undue coercive. Defendant, an active worker of Samajwadi Party and had political resources, on 13.01.2013, came to disputed property so as to forcibly evict plaintiff and his family members and caused law and order situation therein. However, due to neighbors calling and protest defendant could not succeed in his attempt. Defendant then pressurized plaintiff to execute a registered power of attorney in respect to vacant land which is part of disputed property which was denied by plaintiff. Plaintiff's family consists of his wife and two minor children i.e. son aged about 12 years and daughter 14 years. Wife of plaintiff is a school teacher and children are also school going. Plaintiff used to visit different places in the context of his business and had serious apprehension that defendant may forcibly got possession  of property in dispute. Hence, a suit for injunction was instituted by plaintiff respondent seeking permanent injunction restraining defendant from interfering in possession of disputed property of plaintiff.\n5. Suit was contested by defendant appellant vide written statement dated 18.07.2003 wherein he admitted that property was owned by late Ram Rakshpal Singh, who had already died. Thereafter property inherited by widow and eight children of Ram Rakshpal Singh. Widow and two sons of Ram Rakshpal Singh had died but two sons before death had executed an agreement of sale in favour of defendant. It is further admitted that three daughters of Ram Rakshpal Singh had already married and two sons were staying at Varanasi and Haridwar. In paragraph 6 of written statement defendant admitted that some part of disputed property was in possession of plaintiff and some part, in possession of tenants inducted by co-owners of property. It is also admitted in para 7 of written statement that there is/was no partition in respect to property, between legal heirs of Ram Rakshpal Singh, by metes and bounds.\n6. In additional plea defendant appellant pleaded that three sons of Ram Rakshpal Singh namely Ashok Kumar Singh, Manoj Kumar Singh, Arvind Kumar Singh as also three daughters namely Smt. Kumud Singh, Smt. Ranjana Singh and Smt. Aruna Singh executed an agreement to sell their shares in disputed property in favour of defendant, his brother Bhagwant Singh, nephews Manpreet Singh and Rajkumar on 01.01.1998. After execution of aforesaid registered agreement to sell, Manoj Kumar Singh and Arvind Kumar Singh died. Both were un-married at the time of death. Even plaintiff, executed agreement to sell his own share in favour of defendant and three persons named above on 19.02.1998 which is also a registered document.\n7. Another son of Ram Rakshpal Singh, i.e. Ajeet Kumar Singh, executed sale deeds in respect to his share of disputed property in favour of defendant one on 18.04.2000 and another, of same date in favour of defendant's brothers Bhagwant Singh and both of them were given possession. Defendant and other prospective purchasers continued to persuade plaintiff and his brothers and sisters to execute sale deed to which they extended assurance and said that it will be done in future. It is said that all these facts were concealed by plaintiff. Defendant has never attempted to get possession of disputed property as alleged, forcibly, there is no cause of action, proper parties have not been impleaded and suit is liable to be dismissed.\n8. Plaintiff got the suit amended by inserting paragraph 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D, consequently additional written statement dated 21.10.2003 was filed by defendant.\n9. Plaintiff stated in newly added paragraph that on 09.06.2003 and 21.06.2003 again defendant made an attempt to forcibly posses property and also threatened plaintiff's wife in respect whereto she sought to lodge report with Police but it did not register report whereupon Senior Superintendent of Police was informed and on his instructions, Police visited the  site as a result whereof defendant and persons accompanying him, ran away. Disputed property has an area of about four thousand sq. yard. On western side building is constructed in about one thousand sq. yard of land and no part of property is in possession of defendant.\n10. Trial Court, on the basis of pleadings framed three issues which are as under:-\n^^1-\tD;k oknh iz'uxr lEifRr ds Lokeh rFkk dkfct gS ;fn gka rks izHkkoA\n(i)Whether plaintiff is owner in possession over disputed property, if yes, its effect, \n \n 2-\td;k oknh dksbZ okn dkj.k miyC/k ugha gS vkSj okn la/kkfj; ugha gSA\n(ii) Whether plaintiff has no cause of action and suit is not maintainable,\n \n 3-\tvuqrks\"k dksbZ oknh ikus dk vf/kdkjh gksA**\n(iii) Relief if any, petitioner is entitled.\n(English translation by Court)\n11. Issues 1 and 2 were taken together and answered in favour of plaintiff and against defendant-appellant. Consequently, suit was decreed and permanent injunction as prayed for was granted by impugned judgment and decreed dated 13.02.2004 and 26.02.2004.\n12. Ms. Ram Goel Bansal, learned counsel for appellant argued that there were two sale deeds executed by co-sharer of property in dispute in favour of defendant-appellant and in that view of matter he became co-sharer in property in dispute hence decree of permanent injunction could not have been granted against defendant-appellant.\n13. Learned counsel appearing for respondent, per-contra, sought to support the judgment and decree in view of findings recorded by Court below therein.\n14. The points for determination which have arisen in this appeal for its adjudication are:-\n(i) Whether defendant-appellant had status of co-sharer in property in dispute.\n(ii) Whether defendant-appellant had possession over entire or some part of property in dispute.\n(iii) Whether Trial Court was justified in passing decree of permanent injunction in property in dispute against defendant-appellant.\n15. Plaintiff's right over property in dispute as co-owner i.e. co-sharer in property in dispute is admitted. There where eight co-sharers in property in dispute i.e. Ashok Kumar Singh, Arvind Kumar Singh, Satendra Kumar Singh, Manoj Kumar Singh, Ajeet Kumar Singh, Smt. Kumud Singh, Ranjana Singh and Aruna Singh. One of the  brother, Ajeet Kumar Singh, executed two sale deed dated 18.04.2000 in respect of his share i.e. 1/8 in property in dispute in favour of defendant-appellant and his brother Bhagwant Singh. Copies of aforesaid sale deeds are Paper no. 36-Ga/13 and 36-Ga/20. Sale deeds nowhere mention that at the time of execution thereof, vendor Ajeet Kumar Singh, gave actual possession of any part of disputed property to defendant-appellant or his brother Bhagwant Singh.\n16. In the written statement, defendant-appellant has specifically admitted in para 6 that plaintiff is residing in some part of disputed property and some part is in possession of tenants of all co-sharers. It is not stated in the aforesaid paragraph of written statement that the defendant-appellant also had possession over some part of property. It is only in para 20 of written statement where reference of sale deed is made in a vague manner. It is also stated that on execution of sale deed the vendees were also given possession over property in dispute. The possession pleaded in paragraph 28 is clearly a notional one since only share in disputed property was sold by Ajeet Kumar singh for the reason that there was no partition in disputed property by metes and bounds. Only 1/8 share was sold by Sri Ajeet Kumar Singh to the defendant-appellant and his brother Bhagwant Singh. It is also not stated anywhere that vendor actually possess any or some part of property and vendees were put in possession of that part of property. No evidence has been placed before Court below or even before this Court that defendant-appellant actually got possession of any part of property. It is also admitted by defendant-appellant that different co-sharers including plaintiff respondent had executed different agreements to sell but at the time of execution of agreement to sell proposed purchasers were put in possession of property subject to agreement to sell is neither stated in the said agreements nor any evidence otherwise has come on record in this regard. Mere execution of agreement to sell does not result in transfer of ownership of property.\n17. A agreement for sale or contract for sale, by itself is not an instrument giving effect to sale of immoveable property. The title to property agreed to be sold continued to vests in the vendor, in case of agreement for sale, but in case of sale, title or property vests with purchaser. In other words an agreement for sale is an executory contract whereas sale is an executed contract. An agreement for sale does not create an interest in the proposed vendee in the suit property but only creates an enforceable right in parties. An agreement for sale of property, and promise to transfer the property convey the same meaning and effect in law. A promise to transfer property is an agreement for sale of property.\n18.\nIn\nMaung Shwe Goh Vs. Maung Inn\n, 1917(1) Bom LR 179 the Court considered\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882 and said that a contract for sale by virtue of Section 54 creates no interest in or charge upon the land.\n19. Again in\nRupchand Balmukund Aharwala Vs. Jankibai Kanhyalal\n, AIR 1926 Bom 24 the Division Bench of Bombay High Court said that an agreement executed between the parties to divide property at the expiration of litigation would not create any interest on property under the provisions of\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882. A temporary arrangement with regard to profits during litigation is nothing but a system evolved by parties amongst themselves from management of property during litigation, does not mean that it has created any right or interest in property itself.\nThe Court relied on an earlier decision of Privy Council in\nRajangam Ayyar Vs. Rajangam Ayyarta, ILR\n(1922) Mad. 373 where a document, i.e., a memorandum regarding secession of jointness of parties making a declaration that from that time forth the parties became entitled to possession and enjoyment of their properties in separate shares and further providing for execution of further deed effectuating partition would mean that document/ memorandum itself did not create or declare or assign or limit or extinguish any right or interest in the moveable property.\n20. In English Law, there is recognition of two classes of ownership, legal and equitable but this has not been recognized in Indian Law. Here the Legislature has recognized, in its wisdom, only one owner. There has been a catena of authorities including that of Privy Council in\nChhatra Kumari Devi v. Mohan Bikram Shah and Ors.\n, AIR 1931 PC 196 where it was observed that the Indian Law does not recognize legal and equitable estates.\nThe Privy Council referred to and relied on earlier decisions in J.M. Tagore Vs. G.M. Tagore (1872) IA Sup. Vol. 47 and Webb Vs. Macpherson, (1904) 31 Cal 57. The Privy Council further said that by that law there can be only one owner.\n21. It is thus evident that exposition of law is very clear that contract for sale would not make the purchaser/vendee to be owner in equity of estate so long as the sale deed is executed and registered. Mere execution of contract for sale by itself would not create any right or interest in property.\n22.\nIn\nRambaran Prosad v. Ram Mohit Hazra and Ors.\n, AIR 1967 SC 744 it was held that a contract for sale does not create any interest in property. A three Judge Bench of the Court noticed distinction in law as it was prior to enactment of\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882\nand thereafter. In para 14 of the judgment, it said, that in the case of an agreement for sale entered into, prior to passing of Act, 1882 could have resulted in creating an interest in land itself in favour of purchaser. Thereafter the Court referred to the change resulted with enactment of Act, 1882, and in para 17, said as under:\n\". . . . . a mere contract for sale of immovable property does not create any interest in the immovable property and it therefore follows that the rule of perpetuity cannot be applied to a covenant of pre-emption even though there is no time limit within which the option has to be exercised.\" (emphasis added)\n23. The Court also noticed, when agreement itself recited with that sale deed would be executed within three years, the purchaser had a right to sue for specific performance and this by itself mean that agreement for sale does not create any right or interest in property.\n24.\nIn\nJiwan Das Vs. Narain Das\n, AIR 1981 Delhi 291 a Single Judge in para 10 and 11 of the judgment following\nRambaran Prosad\n(supra) said:\n\"10. . . . . . . the law in India does not recognise any such estate.\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act in specific terms provides that a contract for sale does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. Such contract is merely a document creating a right to obtain another document in the form of sale deed to be registered in accordance with law. In other words, a contract for sale is a right created in personam and not in estate, No privity in estate can be deduced there from which can bind estate, as is the position in cases of mortgage, charge or lease. Of course, such personal right created against the vendor to obtain specific performance can ultimately bind any subsequent transferee who obtains transfer of the property with notice of the agreement of sale.\n11. Till, therefore, a decree for specific performance is obtained, the vendor or a purchaser from him is entitled to full enjoyment of the property. In fact, even if a decree for specific performance of contract is obtained, and no sale-deed is actually executed, it cannot be said that any interest in the property has passed.\"\n25.\nIn\nSujan Charan Lenka and others Vs. Smt. Pramila Mumari Mohanty and others\n, AIR 1986 Ori 74 the Court in para 7 of judgment said that a bare contract for sale of immoveable property does not create any interest in immoveable property. Referring to\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882, it says:\n\"7. . . . . . a contract for sale does not, by itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. Such contract is merely a document creating a right to obtain another document in the form of sale deed to be registered in accordance with law. In other words, a contract for sale is a right created in personam and not in estate. No privity in estate can be deduced therefrom which can bind the estate, as is the position in cases of mortgage, charge or lease. Of course, such personal right created against the vendor to obtain specific performance can ultimately bind any subsequent transferee who obtains transfer of the property with notice of the agreement of sale. Till, therefore, a decree for specific performance is obtained, the vendor or a purchaser from him is entitled to full enjoyment of the property. In fact, even if a decree for specific performance of contract is obtained, and no sale-deed is actually executed, it cannot be said that any interest in the property has passed.\"\n26. A Division Bench in Dewan and sons\nInvestments Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Delhi Development Authority\n, AIR 1997 Delhi 388 said:\n\"6. In our opinion, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that as a result of agreement to still dated the 1st May. 1970 in respect of the properly in question, entered into between the petitioner and M/s. Goodwill India Limited, the petitioner had acquired a 'vested right' not only in the property in question bill also to claim a 'No Objection Certificate' on that basis, is devoid of substance. . . . . . .\nIn\nKanaya Ram v. Rajender Kumar\n, AIR 1985 SC 371 their Lordships of the Supreme Court have held that in cases where after oral sales mutation of lands was effected in favour of the transferees even then i.e. after the mutation of properties, no rights accrued in favour of the transferees in respect of such lands as the purported sales and the subsequent mutation based on those sales did not create any right or title in favour of the transferees as the provisions of\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act were not complied with-their being no registered sale deeds. In the present case too the agreement to sell dated the 1st May, 1970 in the absence of any registered sale deed by itself would not be sufficient to create any right or title in favour of the petitioner in respect of the property in question. The registered sale deed, admittedly, in respect of the property in question, was executed on 13-2-90 and thus the petitioners acquired a right and a title in respect of the property in question only after the execution of the registered sale deed on 13-2-90.\" (emphasis added)\n27. A person who has contracted to buy land is not the owner of any interest in the land and is, therefore, not competent to apply to set aside an execution sale of the same land.\n28. Section 54 itself says that a contract for sale does not create any interest in or charge upon such property. This is what has been noticed by this Court in Indira Fruits and General Market, Meerut Vs. Bijendra Kumar Gupta, AIR 1995 All 316.\n29. In other words, a person having an agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the property except the right of litigation on that basis. Sometimes it is also described that a contract for sale is merely a document, creating a right to obtain another document.\n30.\nIn\nImtiaz Ali Vs. Nasim Ahmed\n, AIR 1987 Del 36 it was said that in absence of a registered sale deed, nobody can call himself as owner by purchase, on the basis of agreement for sale and power of attorney executed by alleged vendor in favour of prospective purchaser cum attorney. The agreement for sale, therefore, by itself does not create any status to petitioner to enter into the shoes of owner of building in dispute.\n31. Further in the sale deeds dated 18.04.2000 it is not stated anywhere that any part in the disputed property has been sold and possession has been given to defendant-appellant. Therefore, while possession of plaintiff and some other tenants was admitted by defendant-appellants he clearly failed to prove his own possession over any part of property. It is no doubt true in law a co-sharer is supposed to have an element title and possession over property in question but if there is no partition by metes and bounds and co-sharer is not in actual possession over disputed property, he can get possession only after having partition by metes and bounds and not forcibly or by any other means not authorised by law.\n32. In view thereof, even if defendant-appellant is co-sharer in the present case, Court below has rightly decreed the suit of plaintiff-respondent granting permanent injunction that defendant-appellant shall not interfer in possession of plaintiff-respondent but we clarify hereat that this injunction is subject to further order which may be passed by any Court of competent jurisdiction, if any co-sharer including defendant-appellant brings appropriate action in law for partition of co-owned property by metes and bounds and thereafter claim possession over part of property which comes to their share.\n33. The questions no. 2 and 3 formulated above are answered against appellant which question 1 is returned in affirmative i.e. in favour of appellant.\n34. Subject to aforesaid clarification/observation, we find no merit in this appeal.\n35. It is accordingly dismissed.\nOrder Date :- 22.2.2016\n \nPravin",

Present second appeal has been instituted against the judgment and decree dated 25.2.2004, passed by Addl. District Judge/Special Judge (S.C./S.T. Act), Jhansi passed in Civil Appeal No. 95/99, Sri Karodi and Anr. v. Dasai and Anr. By the impugned judgment and decree learned appellate court dismissed the appeal of the appellants with costs.\n2. The perusal of the judgment of the court below shows that Original Suit No. 130 of 1997, Dasai v. Karodi and Anr. was instituted for declaration to the affect that the sale-deed dated 23.4.97 is null and void and liable to be cancelled. It has been alleged in the plaint that there were three brothers of the plaintiff, namely, Shyam Lal defendant No. 3, Dasai plaintiff and Brij Bhushan. That the disputed property situated at Mohalla Gudari town Ranipur Pargana Mau District Jhansi is the ancestral property of the plaintiff and his brothers. That a partition took place of the disputed house in between the plaintiff and his brothers in the month of September, 1985 and a deed dated 29.9.85 was also executed. Defendant No. 3 also put his signature on the partition deed. That all the brothers are in possession of their share according to the partition. A part of the house was delivered to the defendant No. 3 in the house. But defendant No. 3 with mala fide intention executed a sale-deed on 23.4.97 in favour of defendants No. 1 and 2 in consideration of Rs. 40,000. That defendant No. 3 was neither the owner nor in possession of the house in dispute hence he was not competent to execute the sale deed. The sale deed was void and ineffective. The defendant appellants contested the suit and filed written statement and denied the contention of the plaint. It has specifically been alleged that the house in question was never partitioned in between the plaintiff and his brothers. That a document signed by Shyam Lal is not a registered document. Hence, the partition deed is not in accordance of law and is not binding on the appellants defendants and the partition deed is a void document. Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 also filed separate written statement and he also admitted that the property in dispute was sold to defendant by the sale-deed. Both the parties produced oral as well as documentary evidence before the trial court and trial court after framing issues decreed the suit of the plaintiff-respondents and a sale-deed dated 23.4.97 executed by Shyam Lal in favour of Karodi and Pyare Lal was set aside. Being aggrieved from the judgment and decree of the trial court the appellant instituted Civil Appeal No. 95 of 1999, in the Court of District Judge and Addl. District Judge/Special Judge, Jhansi dismissed the appeal vide judgment and decree dated 25.2.2004 and against this judgment and decree of the appellate court this instant second appeal has been instituted.\n3. I have heard learned Counsel for the appellants Sri Arvlnd Srlvastava and Vivek Shandllya and Sudheer Sandilya advocate for the respondents and perused the entire material on record and as well as the judgment of the courts below.\n4. It has mainly been argued by learned Counsel for the appellant that the suit was filed for cancellation of the sale-deed dated 23.4.97. That this property in dispute was the self acquired property of Shyam Lal respondent No. 2. It is wrong to allege that the disputed property is a joint property of the parties. He also argued that the courts below placed reliance on partition deed dated 29.9.85. But this partition deed is a waste paper as is unregistered document and according to law a partition deed is required to be compulsorily registered and this partition deed is unregistered deed, hence it cannot be accepted as a partition deed at all. That the defendants appellant proved the title of the Shyam Lal that he got this property from Zamindar and thereafter he constructed the house. That this house was not the joint property of the plaintiff and his other brothers. That in view of the judgment of Allahabad High Court in AIR 1989 All 133 and AIR 1999 All 167, the document is inadmissible. He also cited judgment of High Court of Allahabad in AIR 1980 All 180 and on the basis of the judgments he argued that even for collateral purpose this unregistered partition deed cannot be relied. He cited various other judgments of this Court to supplement of his argument. That the courts below were not justified in discarding the evidence produced by the defendants to prove the title of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3. Learned Counsel for the respondent disputed the argument of learned Counsel for the appellant and further argued that in view of the partition deed dated 29.9.95 the property in dispute was joint property of plaintiff and his brothers. That for collateral purpose the partition deed is admissible. That whether the property in dispute is a Joint property or not this is a collateral purpose and for this purpose the partition deed must be relied. And the courts below considered the entire evidence and circumstances of the case and recorded a finding of fact. That in the present second appeal no substantial question of law is involved and the second appeal cannot be admitted only on the point of fact. And in support of his argument he placed reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court.\n5. I have considered the argument of learned Counsel for the parties and the facts and circumstances of the case. Udnisputedly the plaintiff respondents instituted the suit for cancellation of the sale-deed executed by Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 in favour of defendants No. 1 and 2, alleging that the property in dispute is a joint family property and defendant No. 3 alone is not competent to execute the sale-deed of the property in favour of the appellants. A material question is to be decided in this case was whether the property is a joint family property of the plaintiff and his brothers on the self acquired property of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 and brothers of the plaintiff. And the plaintiff was required to prove that the property in dispute is a joint property of the family and to fortify the contention the respondent-plaintiff placed reliance on the partition deed dated 29.9.85. This is an undisputed fact that this partition deed is a unregistered document and this is an admitted and settled position of law that the partition deed is compulsorily registerable. If a document compulsorily registerable and the same has not been registered then no right and title will accrue in favour of the person in whose favour the documents has been executed. Both the learned Counsel for the parties agreed that unregistered deed is admissible only for limited purpose. This is admissible for collateral purpose and what is collateral purpose is also material to be decided.\nIn the present case, this is not very material to be decided that whether any right and title accrued to the parties on the basis of unregistered document regarding allocation of his share of the property. Because for that purpose the partition deed is not admissible. But whether the property is a joint property or self acquired property of Shyam Lal can be decided on the basis of this unregistered deed and it is also material to be decided whether this is a collateral purpose for which unregistered document is admissible. Learned Counsel for the respondent cited a Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in\nKale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation and Ors.\n1976 RD 355. The judgment was rendered by three Hon'ble Judges of Hon'ble Apex Court. It has been held in this judgment:\nA family arrangement being binding on the parties to the arrangement clearly operates as an estoppel so as to preclude any of the parties who have taken advantage under the agreement from revoking or challenging the same. Even if the family arrangement was not registered it could be used for a collateral purpose, namely, for the purpose of showing the nature and character of possession of the parties in pursuance of the family settlement and also for the purpose of applying the rule of estoppel which flowed from the conduct of the parties who having taken benefit under the settlement keep their mouths shut resile from the settlement.\n6. Hence, the above judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court shows that a family arrangement reduced into writing and the same was not registered is admissible for collateral purposes. And this family settlement is also relevant for relying the rule of estoppel. In view of this judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court the partition deed dated 29.9.85 is relevant to this extent that the property in dispute was partitioned in between the plaintiff and his brothers. And afterwards the parties to this agreement or deed cannot deny the factum of jointness of the property. It has not been shown by learned Counsel for the appellant that this Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court\nhas been overruled\nsubsequently. And in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court the other judgment cited by learned Counsel for the appellants are not relevant for this purpose. Learned Counsel for the appellants cited a number of rulings:\n1.\nBalkrishna Das Agarwal v. Smt. Radha Devi and Ors.\n;\n2.\nBankey Bihari v. Surya Narain\nAIR 1999 All 167 : 1998 (3) AWC 1616;\n3.\nSrinivas Krishnarao Kango v. Narayan Devji Kango and Ors.\n;\n4.\nJ.B. Sharma v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.\n1988 (Supp) SCC 451;\n5.\nDilbagrai Punjabi v. Sharad Chandra\n1988 (Supp) SCC 710;\n6.\nBanarasi Das v. Brij Maharaja Sukhjit Singh and Anr.\n1998 (5) SC 138;\n7. Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh ; and\n8.\nNeelakantan and Ors. v. Mallika Begum\n.\nThe above judgments are of no help to the appellants.\n7. Learned Counsel for the respondents also argued that in the present appeal no substantial question of law is involved. The finding was recorded on the basis of facts and this Court in second appeal cannot interfere merely in the finding of fact. And in support of his argument cited\nChacko and Anr. v. Mahadevan\n2007 (3) CCC 335 : 2007 (4) AWC 3577 (SC). It has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court:\nIt may be mentioned that in a first appeal filed under\nSection 96\n, C.P.C., the appellate court can go into questions of fact, whereas in a second appeal filed under\nSection 100\n, C.P.C. the High Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact of the first appellate court, and it is confined only to questions of law. Hence we have to see the judgment of the first appellate court and its findings of fact....\nHence in view of the Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court the second appeal can only be admitted if any substantial question of law is involved.\nIn another judgment in\nGurdev Kaur and Ors. v. Kaki and Ors.\n, Hon'ble Apex Court held that:\nIt must be clearly understood that the legislative intention was very clear that Legislature never wanted second appeal to become \"third trial on facts\" or one more dice in the gamble.\n8. Hence in view of the judgment. of Hon'ble Apex Court the second appeal must be entertained in the circumstances when any substantial question of law is involved and as I have stated above that in the present case no substantial question of law is involved. Both the courts below recorded the finding of fact. Learned Counsel for the appellant formulated substantial question of law and I have perused these substantial question framed by the appellant's counsel and I am of the opinion that all these points are question of fact and these cannot be called as substantial question of law. It has been established from the partition arrangement dated 29.9.1985 that the property in dispute was joint property of the plaintiff and his brothers and defendant No. 3 Shyam Lal alone was not entitled to execute the sale-deed of the entire house. The share of Shyam Lal in the disputed house is only to the extent of one third. And on the basis of the sale deed the appellants can be co-sharer alongwith other brother*. These appellants stepped into the shoes of the defendant No. 3 and in the circumstances of the case the entire sale deed cannot be adjudged null and void but the sale deed is certainly effective to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal. The judgment of the appellate court is to be modified to this extent that the appellant shall be sharer in the property in dispute alongwith plaintiff and his brothers to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal and the entire sale deed cannot be adjudged as null and void because Shyam Lal is the co-sharer with plaintiff and his other brothers and the share of Shyam Lal in the disputed house was to the extent of one third share. Shyam Lal could have not executed the sale deed of entire house and as Shyam Lal has executed the sale deed of entire house hence the sale deed shall be valid to the extent of one third share. It cannot be said that on the basis of the sale deed appellant shall have no share rather the appellant shall be sharer to the extent of one third share and they can file the suit of partition of one third share.\n9. For the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that no substantial question of law is involved in this case except to this effect that the courts below cancelled the entire sale deed. Whereas the sale deed is perfectly valid to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3. With this modification the second appeal is liable to be disposed of at this stage. The second appeal is disposed of finally with the partial modification to the effect that the appellant shall be co-sharer in the property in dispute alongwith plaintiff and his other brothers to the extent of one third share of respondent No. 2.",
