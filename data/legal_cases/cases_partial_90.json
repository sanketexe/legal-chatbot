This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others. During his cross-examination, he has stated that he is a\nresident of Hatia, Chainpur; he has got no property in Kanderbera where\nthe suit property is situated; he was unable to give the Khata number and\nplot number of the suit property ; he had not seen any documents in\nconnection with the property; he could not say the boundary of the property;\nthe rent was being paid with respect to the disputed property, but he has not\nseen the rent receipt; he does not know as to how much paddy is grown on\nthe property, however, he has stated that he used to cultivate the land.\nHe further stated that he had not seen Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knows\nHari Narayan Parikh; he does not know Govindji B. Thakkar. He has also\ndenied having known other family members. He has simply stated that he\nknows Piyush and Prakash. At the time of measurement by Amin, he was\npresent but no document was prepared and he did not sign any document;\nhe has stated that he does not know Jayesh and Hemant and he does not\nknow the name of defendants. He could not say as to by whom and how the\ndisputed property was acquired. He was not able to give the details of the\nneighbourhood of the property. He did not know that the property was\npurchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and whether\nthey used to pay rent to the government. He could not say that after death\nof Manikant G. Thakkar, half portion of the suit property devolved upon his\nsons and daughters. He also could not say that the two daughters and the\n36\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntwo sons of Manikant G. Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined. During cross-\nexamination he stated that he is the resident of Kanderbera and has ancestral\nproperty but could not give the details of his property nor could he give the\ndetails of the disputed property; He stated that he has heard of Khata\nNo.102 but had not seen it; He has stated that he had not seen Manikant G.\nThakkar; the plaintiffs have filed case against the defendants but he does\nnot know their name; Indulal G. Thakkar had expired and he had not seen\nany paper other than the plaint. He has also stated that Yashomati (Plaintiff\nno.1) had told him that he has to go for deposing in the court. He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired. He had not\nseen the father of Manikant G. Thakkar and has no idea as to how many\nbrothers were Manikant G. Thakkar. He is not aware as to how the disputed\nproperty was acquired by Manikant G. Thakkar. He had not been to the\nhouse of Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knew him. He has further stated that\nhe is not aware about the date of partition nor he has seen any document\nnor any partition had taken place in his presence. He is not aware as to\nwhich plot was allotted to whom during partition and the property was\nnever measured in his presence. He could not say that Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas alive and he was defendant no.8. He has stated that it was correct that\ndefendant Rahat Saeed Khan has constructed some house over the property\nand is carrying on business from the said property. He could not say the\ndate and month of construction of the house. The other property sold to\nMithila Motors is being occupied by them. During cross-examination by\ndefendant no.9, he stated that in the disputed property Hari Narayan Parikh\nhad made 8 rooms and was in possession of the same.\n54.   PW-3 is the Plaintiff No. 5, Mr. Piyush I. Thakkar, son of the late\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He has identified the suit land located in Kandarbera,\nThana No. 327, Khata No. 102, with a total area of 17.94 acres. He stated\nthat the Plaintiffs along with Defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and Proforma\nDefendants No. 10, 11, and 12, are all descendants of the late Govindji B.\nThakkar. The Principal Defendants are Defendants No. 5 to 9, who had no\nrelationship with Govindji Thakkar. While giving the genealogy, the said\ndefendant had stated that Govindji Thakkar had four sons, Manikant G.\nThakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar, Mukundlal G. Thakkar, and Chandrakant G.\nThakkar. After death, his property devolved upon his four sons. He stated\nthat on 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, along with one Hari Narayan\nParikh, purchased the suit land through registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n26.09.1959; the property was purchased from the joint family fund of\nManikant G. Thakkar, as he was the Karta of the family; the property was\nmutated jointly in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh; consequently, Manikant G. Thakkar was the owner of the half share\n38\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the property jointly with his three brothers; Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property. He referred to earlier Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982 filed by Hari Narayan Parikh seeking declaration of his right,\ntitle and interest over the entire property covered by the sale deed dated\n26.09.1959; the suit was decreed by the judgment dated 30.05.1992. The\njudgment passed in the said title suit was subject matter of appeal in Title\nAppeal No. 10 of 1992, in which the plaintiffs were also included. He\nfurther stated that in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the wife of Manikant G.\nThakkar and his son Jayesh M. Thakkar deposed that the half share of the\ndisputed property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in family partition.\nThe Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was allowed, and the judgment and decree\nwere set aside, and it was held that Hari Narayan Parikh was entitled only\nto half share of the property. Against the judgment, Hari Narayan Parikh\nfiled Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R), which was also dismissed. He\nasserted that thereafter the plaintiffs continued to remain in possession of\nthe property. He deposed that suddenly in the year 2011, the defendant nos.\n1 and 2 filed application before the Circle Officer for demarcation of land\nupon which the plaintiffs objected, but in spite of that, demarcation was\ndone in Demarcation Case No. 43 of 2011-2012, wherein Hari Narayan\nParikh gave in writing that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year\n1973, the half share of the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in\nfamily arrangement . The order passed in the demarcation case was\nchallenged before the High Court in CWJC No.1354 of 2012, which was\ndismissed against which LPA No. 310 of 2012 was filed, but the same was\nalso dismissed with observation.

Thakkar was made\n43\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nparty in the suit; he is aware that in the suit, half share each was declared in\nfavour of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has denied\nthe suggestion that the descendants of Manikant G. Thakkar did not have\nthe right to sell the property because Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund of all the brothers. He has denied that\nthe plaintiffs were having right, title, interest and possession with respect to\nthe property.\n57.   So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he is Gulab Chandra Manjhi.

Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land.

He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

No. 9      : Mr. Amitabh Prasad, Advocate\n---\nLastly heard on 25/02/2025\n\n14/08.05.2025\n1.    This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar. A number of documentary\nevidences were also exhibited before the learned trial Court which are as\nunder:\n\"Exhibit-1, Legal Notice dated 23.09.2019\n     Exhibit-1/A.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.   The plaintiffs had prayed for the following reliefs: -\n(i) for a declaration of right, title, interest of the plaintiffs over\n         half portion of the schedule 'A' land'.\n(ii) for confirmation of possession of the plaintiff over half\n         portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(iii) for a declaration that the sale deed No. 687 dated\n         06/03/2012 executed by the defendant No. 5 in favour of the\n         defendants No. 6 and 7 registered at Sub Registry office\n         Seraikella is null and void, and did not confer any right in\n         favour of the defendants No. 6 and 7.\n(iv) for a declaration that the sale deed. No. 4324 dated\n         20.10.2012 executed by the defendant No. 8 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9 registered at Sub Registry office Seraikella is\n         null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9.\n(v) for a declaration that the mutation order passed by the C.O.\n         Chandil in mutation case No. 2446/2011-12 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 6 and 7 is illegal and arbitrary.\n(vi) for an injunction restraining the defendants No. 6, 7 and 9\n         not to come over any portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(vii) for cost of the suit.\n(viii) for any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiffs are\n         deemed entitled under the law and equity.\"\n35.   The description of the property involved in this case is as under: -\nSchedule-'A'\n           Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n          Khata No. 102,            Plot No. 559, Area A0.46\n                                    Plot No. 560, Area A01.16\n                                    Plot No. 565, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 563, Area A01.64\n                                    Plot No. 558, Area A02.75\n                                    Plot No. 581, Area A02.89\n                                    Plot No. 586, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 587, AreaA01.41\n                                    Plot No. 562, Area A01.30\n                                    Plot No. 557, Area A00.71\n                                          Total 17.94\n\n\n Schedule-'B' (half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 1 to 4 to\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through power of attorney holder-defendant no.5-\n              covered by sale deed No. 687 dated 06/03/2012 )\n            Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n            Khata No. 102,    Plot No. 563, Area 1.64\n                              Plot No. 565, Area 3.31\n30\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n                              Plot No. 581, Area 2.89\n                              Plot No. 559, Area 0.20\n                              Plot No. 560, Area 0.73\n                              Plot No. 562, Area 0.20\n                                    Total Area 8.97\n\n\n Schedule-'C'(half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 8 to\n  defendant no.9 covered by sale deed.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same.

Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.   The plaintiffs had prayed for the following reliefs: -\n(i) for a declaration of right, title, interest of the plaintiffs over\n         half portion of the schedule 'A' land'.\n(ii) for confirmation of possession of the plaintiff over half\n         portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(iii) for a declaration that the sale deed No. 687 dated\n         06/03/2012 executed by the defendant No. 5 in favour of the\n         defendants No. 6 and 7 registered at Sub Registry office\n         Seraikella is null and void, and did not confer any right in\n         favour of the defendants No. 6 and 7.\n(iv) for a declaration that the sale deed. No. 4324 dated\n         20.10.2012 executed by the defendant No. 8 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9 registered at Sub Registry office Seraikella is\n         null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9.\n(v) for a declaration that the mutation order passed by the C.O.\n         Chandil in mutation case No. 2446/2011-12 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 6 and 7 is illegal and arbitrary.\n(vi) for an injunction restraining the defendants No. 6, 7 and 9\n         not to come over any portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(vii) for cost of the suit.\n(viii) for any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiffs are\n         deemed entitled under the law and equity.\"\n35.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others.

Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined.

He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired.

Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property.

Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\nDuring his cross-examination, he has stated that he has his own land in\nKanderbera. He has no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was the brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land. He has denied that the disputed\nland was being cultivated by Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, his\ndescendants were in possession of the property. He has stated that Sabita\nMahto is the Member of Legislative Assembly (M.L.A.) and at the relevant\npoint of time, her husband Sudhir Mahto was the Deputy Chief Minister of\nthe State of Jharkhand and despite objection by the plaintiffs the property\nwas mutated. He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others. During his cross-examination, he has stated that he is a\nresident of Hatia, Chainpur; he has got no property in Kanderbera where\nthe suit property is situated; he was unable to give the Khata number and\nplot number of the suit property ; he had not seen any documents in\nconnection with the property; he could not say the boundary of the property;\nthe rent was being paid with respect to the disputed property, but he has not\nseen the rent receipt; he does not know as to how much paddy is grown on\nthe property, however, he has stated that he used to cultivate the land.\nHe further stated that he had not seen Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knows\nHari Narayan Parikh; he does not know Govindji B. Thakkar. He has also\ndenied having known other family members. He has simply stated that he\nknows Piyush and Prakash. At the time of measurement by Amin, he was\npresent but no document was prepared and he did not sign any document;\nhe has stated that he does not know Jayesh and Hemant and he does not\nknow the name of defendants. He could not say as to by whom and how the\ndisputed property was acquired. He was not able to give the details of the\nneighbourhood of the property. He did not know that the property was\npurchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and whether\nthey used to pay rent to the government. He could not say that after death\nof Manikant G. Thakkar, half portion of the suit property devolved upon his\nsons and daughters. He also could not say that the two daughters and the\n36\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntwo sons of Manikant G. Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined. During cross-\nexamination he stated that he is the resident of Kanderbera and has ancestral\nproperty but could not give the details of his property nor could he give the\ndetails of the disputed property; He stated that he has heard of Khata\nNo.102 but had not seen it; He has stated that he had not seen Manikant G.\nThakkar; the plaintiffs have filed case against the defendants but he does\nnot know their name; Indulal G. Thakkar had expired and he had not seen\nany paper other than the plaint. He has also stated that Yashomati (Plaintiff\nno.1) had told him that he has to go for deposing in the court. He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired. He had not\nseen the father of Manikant G. Thakkar and has no idea as to how many\nbrothers were Manikant G. Thakkar. He is not aware as to how the disputed\nproperty was acquired by Manikant G. Thakkar. He had not been to the\nhouse of Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knew him. He has further stated that\nhe is not aware about the date of partition nor he has seen any document\nnor any partition had taken place in his presence. He is not aware as to\nwhich plot was allotted to whom during partition and the property was\nnever measured in his presence. He could not say that Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas alive and he was defendant no.8. He has stated that it was correct that\ndefendant Rahat Saeed Khan has constructed some house over the property\nand is carrying on business from the said property. He could not say the\ndate and month of construction of the house. The other property sold to\nMithila Motors is being occupied by them. During cross-examination by\ndefendant no.9, he stated that in the disputed property Hari Narayan Parikh\nhad made 8 rooms and was in possession of the same.\n54.   PW-3 is the Plaintiff No. 5, Mr. Piyush I. Thakkar, son of the late\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He has identified the suit land located in Kandarbera,\nThana No. 327, Khata No. 102, with a total area of 17.94 acres. He stated\nthat the Plaintiffs along with Defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and Proforma\nDefendants No. 10, 11, and 12, are all descendants of the late Govindji B.\nThakkar. The Principal Defendants are Defendants No. 5 to 9, who had no\nrelationship with Govindji Thakkar. While giving the genealogy, the said\ndefendant had stated that Govindji Thakkar had four sons, Manikant G.\nThakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar, Mukundlal G. Thakkar, and Chandrakant G.\nThakkar. After death, his property devolved upon his four sons. He stated\nthat on 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, along with one Hari Narayan\nParikh, purchased the suit land through registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n26.09.1959; the property was purchased from the joint family fund of\nManikant G. Thakkar, as he was the Karta of the family; the property was\nmutated jointly in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh; consequently, Manikant G. Thakkar was the owner of the half share\n38\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the property jointly with his three brothers; Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property. He referred to earlier Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982 filed by Hari Narayan Parikh seeking declaration of his right,\ntitle and interest over the entire property covered by the sale deed dated\n26.09.1959; the suit was decreed by the judgment dated 30.05.1992. The\njudgment passed in the said title suit was subject matter of appeal in Title\nAppeal No. 10 of 1992, in which the plaintiffs were also included. He\nfurther stated that in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the wife of Manikant G.\nThakkar and his son Jayesh M. Thakkar deposed that the half share of the\ndisputed property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in family partition.\nThe Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was allowed, and the judgment and decree\nwere set aside, and it was held that Hari Narayan Parikh was entitled only\nto half share of the property. Against the judgment, Hari Narayan Parikh\nfiled Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R), which was also dismissed. He\nasserted that thereafter the plaintiffs continued to remain in possession of\nthe property. He deposed that suddenly in the year 2011, the defendant nos.\n1 and 2 filed application before the Circle Officer for demarcation of land\nupon which the plaintiffs objected, but in spite of that, demarcation was\ndone in Demarcation Case No. 43 of 2011-2012, wherein Hari Narayan\nParikh gave in writing that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year\n1973, the half share of the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in\nfamily arrangement . The order passed in the demarcation case was\nchallenged before the High Court in CWJC No.1354 of 2012, which was\ndismissed against which LPA No. 310 of 2012 was filed, but the same was\nalso dismissed with observation. It was also deposed that in the month of\nMarch 2012, the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants Nos. 6 and 7\ngot the land mutated in their name on the basis of registered deed No. 687\ndated 06.03.2012, executed through the power of attorney, namely\ndefendant No. 5. It was asserted by P.W. 3 that the land of the plaintiffs was\nwrongly transferred by defendant No. 5, the power of attorney holder of\n39\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndefendant Nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant Nos. 6 and 7. The application\nfor mutation was objected by the plaintiffs, but in spite of that, mutation\nwas allowed against which Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was filed,\nand the matter was remanded back to the Circle Officer.

Thakkar was made\n43\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nparty in the suit; he is aware that in the suit, half share each was declared in\nfavour of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has denied\nthe suggestion that the descendants of Manikant G. Thakkar did not have\nthe right to sell the property because Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund of all the brothers. He has denied that\nthe plaintiffs were having right, title, interest and possession with respect to\nthe property.\n57.   So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he is Gulab Chandra Manjhi.

He has also fully supported the case of the defendants as that of\nD.W. 1 and has confirmed the right, title, interest and possession of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 with respect to the half share of the property which\nwas purchased by Manikant G.

Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land.

He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

The appellant/defendant No. 2 has filed the Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof the C.P.C. challenging the judgment and decree\n           dated 27.01.2009 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,\n2\n(F.T.C.), Balod District - Durg in Civil Appeal No. 08-A/2007, by\n   which learned Additional District Judge, Balod has dismissed the\n   appeal affirming the judgment and decree dated 20.12.1999\n   passed by the Second Civil Judge Class -2, Balod, District - Durg\n   in Civil Suit No. 229-A/98 by which learned Second Civil Judge\n   Class-2 has allowed the suit in part by declaring that plaintiffs\n   after death of Kachra Bai are entitled to get 1/4 th share in the suit\n   property.\n2. The appeal was admitted on 03.07.2020 on the substantial\n   question of law which was further modified on 05.07.2021 and the\n   substantial question of law has been reframed as under :-\n(I) Whether both the Courts below were justified in decreeing\n       the suit by holding that documents Ex.-D/1 and D/2 are\n       inadmissible in evidence under the law for want of registration\n       thereby recorded a perverse finding?\n3. For the sake of convenience, the parties shall be referred to in\n   terms of their status in Civil Suit No. 229-A/98.\n4. The plaint averments, in brief, are that plaintiffs have filed civil suit\n   before the Second Civil Judge, Class II, Balod, District - Durg\n   13.08.1998 for declaration and injunction contending that the suit\n   property situated at village Kharwahi, Tahsil - Gurur bearing\n   Khasra No. 246 area 0.72 R.A. recorded in the name of\n   defendants No. 1 and 2. It has been contended that Plaintiff's\n   father Rambharosa were three brothers namely Kanwali,\n   Bishambhar and Punau. Kachra Bai was wife of Punau. Punau\n   died issue-less on 25.08.1995. Plaintiffs are legal heirs of Kanwali\n   and defendants No. 1 and 2 are legal heirs of Bishambhar.\n   Plaintiffs and defendants No. 1 and 2 are member of the joint\n   Hindu family as such they are governed by\nHindu Succession Act,\n   1956\n. There was no partition with regard to the suit property,\n   therefore, the suit property is in joint possession of plaintiffs as\n   well as defendants No. 1 and 2.          Father of the plaintiffs and\n   defendants No. 1 and 2 have inherited the property from their\n   father and after death of father of the plaintiffs and defendants\n   No. 1 and 2, they have succeeded. Due to death of Punau as he\n   was issueless the property was recorded in the name of Kachra\n   Bai. Kachra Bai also died in the year 1996. Plaintiff left the village\n   for livelihood, but used to come to village for agricultural work.\n3\nWhen the plaintiff No. 1 Rambharosa came to know that Kachra\n   Bai has expired, he went to Revenue Office for deleting the name\n   of Kachra Bai, then he came to know that mutation process is\n   going with regard to suit property before the Tahsildar, Gurur\n   wherein his name was deleted. The plaintiff-Rambharosa raised\n   objection that without his knowledge defendants No. 1 and 2 have\n   deleted his name from revenue record, therefore, he requested\n   that along with name of defendants No. 1 and 2 his name shall\n   also be recorded in the revenue record. The revenue Court has\n   passed the order against the plaintiff Rambharosa on 22.09.1997,\n   against which he preferred an appeal, which has also been\n   rejected. This has caused adverse effect to the interest of the\n   plaintiff, therefore, he has filed the suit. It is further contended that\n   suit property was never divided, therefore, plaintiffs are entitled for\n   ½ share of the suit property. Defendants No. 1 and 2 have illegally\n   taken possession, therefore, it may kindly be declared that they\n   are entitled for ½ share of the suit property.\n5. The defendants No. 1 and 2 filed their written statement denying\n   the allegations made in the plaint contending that with regard to\n   the disputed property partition has already been taken place on\n   20.03.1971 in presence of the Panchayat where father of the\n   plaintiffs had given written consent. The plaintiffs' father had\n   executed an agreement on 13.02.1978 relinquishing his share in\n   favour of the defendants and after selling the share of their\n   property the plaintiffs have no right over the suit property and the\n   suit is not tenable. Since family partition has already been taken\n   place therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to get partition of the\n   suit property as their rights have already been extinguished. This\n   fact is within the knowledge of Kanwali and his legal heirs, as\n   such the suit is not tenable. On the basis of this partition deed,\n   0.47 Ha. of the suit land has also been sold to one Nand Kishore\n   Tiwari by defendants No. 1 and 2 and Late Kachra Bai jointly, as\n   such rest of the property belongs to defendants No. 1 and 2 and\n   Kachra Bai. It has also been contended that plaintiffs have never\n   done agricultural work on the suit property as they are not in\n   possession of the property, whereas, defendants are in\n   possession of the property and doing agricultural work. The\n4\nplaintiffs are well aware of the fact of the case and they have filed\n     the present suit after lapse of 12 years, they have not challenged\n     the right of the defendants, therefore, on account of principle of\n     adverse possession, their rights have been extinguished, and\n     would pray for dismissal of suit.\n6. Defendant No. 3 has filed separate written statement contending\n     that the partition has already been taken place and the plaintiffs\n     have already sold property of their share and have raised false\n     objection before the revenue Court. They have no right over the\n     suit property. Kachra Bai before her death has executed a will in\n     favour of him, as such he is legal heir of Late Kachra Bai,\n     therefore, plaintiffs are not entitled for ½ share of property but\n     defendants 1 and 2 are entitled for ½ of share of the property, and\n     would pray for dismissal of the suit.\n7. On the pleadings of the parties, learned trial Court has framed as\n     many as 7 issues.\n8. The    plaintiffs   to   substantiate    their   case   have   examined\n     Bishambhar as PW/1, Kamal as PW/2, Tulsiram as PW/3,\n     Rambharosa As PW/4 and exhibited documents Certified copy of\n     Sansodhan Panji, as Ex.P/1, Khasra Panchsala of 1977-78 as\n     Ex.P/2 and Order passed by SDO dated 22.06.1995 as Ex.P/3.\n9.   Defendants to substantiate their case have exhibited documents\n     Ex.D/1 Receipt dated 28.03.1971 and Ex. D/2 Ikrarnama dated\n     13.02.1978, Ex.D/3 order dated 22.10.1997 of Tahsildar and\n     Ex.D/4 order of SDO dated 22.06.1995 and examined Jhunni Bai\n     as DW/1, Kanhaiya Lal as DW/2.\n10. The plaintiff witness PW/1 Bishambhar was cross-examined\n     wherein he has admitted that after the death of Kachra Bai,\n     Sukham and Munni Bai are earning from the suit property and this\n     fact is in the knowledge of Rambharosa. He has also admitted\n     that Nandkishore has purchased the property of the Kanwali's\n     family. PW/2 Kamal has also admitted that after the death of\n     Kachra Bai, Sukham and Munni Bai are earning from the suit\n     property. PW/3 Tulsiram has denied the fact that Sukham and\n     Munni Bai are earning from the suit property. He has said that\n     along with Rambharosa they are earning. He has admitted that\n     before the death of Kachra Bai, Rambharosa was living at Durg-\n5\nCharama, Simga. PW/4 Rambharosa has stated that without his\n   knowledge his name was deleted from the revenue record. He\n   has moved an application before the Tahsildar, Gurur which was\n   dismissed. Against that order appeal was also preferred before\n   the SDO, Balod which was also dismissed. He has also admitted\n   that his father had three brothers namely Kanwali, Bishambhar\n   and Punau. Since, Punau was issueless he has additional rights\n   over the suit property. The witness was cross-examined wherein\n   he has denied that his father has given consent with regard to\n   partition. He has admitted that out of the disputed land he has\n   sold some portion to Nand Kishore and he has also admitted that\n   he has utilised this money at the time of his marriage. He has also\n   denied that after marriage he left the place for employment but he\n   used to visit the village. He has admitted that he has not given\n   any application for partition. Kachra Bai, Sukham Bai and Munni\n   Bai were earning from the suit property but he has never objected\n   as his name was there in the revenue record. He has denied that\n   after partition he has sold the property, that is why he has not\n   objected it. He has admitted that for the last 15 years defendants\n   are earning from the suit property. He has denied that his\n   application for mutation has been rejected on the count that he\n   has already received his share on partition.\n11. Defendant No. 1 examined DW/1 Jhunni Bai D/o Bisambhar who\n   has stated that they were earning from the suit property for the\n   last 21 years and 28 years before a family settlement was made,\n   partition was done and Kanwali has mentioned about the family\n   partition which is exhibited as Ex.D/1, the documents were written\n   by the Sarpanch Awadhram. Awadhram expired. But, at the time\n   of documentation Kartikram, Awadhram and other persons were\n   present. She has brought original copy of Ex. D/2 wherein\n   Plaintiffs Bharosa, Pyari Bai, Duleshwar, Bhagwati have executed\n   an agreement of relinquishment of their share in favour of\n   Sukhumat Bai, Munni Bai and Kachra Bai, at that time, Awadhram\n   and Kuntulal Bhoi were also present, but both of them have\n   expired. She has also admitted that Rambharosa has sold 1.15\n   acres of land to Nandkishore of village Kharwahi. After\n   documentation of Ex.D/2 she along with Sukhmat was doing\n6\nagricultural work, which was never objected by any person.\n   Rambharosa has demanded his partition only after the death of\n   Kachra Bai. Manoj S/o Balbhadra has also filed an application\n   before Tahsildar, Gurur in which they have participated and their\n   application was rejected which is Exhibited as Ex. D/3. The order\n   was challenged before SDO, Balod which was also rejected, copy\n   of the order is exhibited as Ex. D/4. She has also admitted that\n   Punau Ram expired prior to Kachra Bai and they are issueless.\n   This witness was cross-examined wherein she has denied that\n   there was no partition between Kanwali, Bisambhar and Punau.\n   She has also denied that at the time of documentation of Ex.D/1\n   Kachra Bai was present. She has denied that Kanwal Ram has\n   not written the relinquishment deed. The dispute with regard to\n   suit property occurred after death of Kachra Bai. Other witness\n   Kanhaiya Lal DW/2 was examined where he has admitted that he\n   was present at the time of partition between the three brothers,\n   but at the time of finalisation he left the place. He has denied that\n   he does not know anything about the partition.\n12. Learned trial court appreciating the evidence, material on record\n   has partly allowed the suit filed by the plaintiffs holding that\n   plaintiffs are entitled for ¼th share of the suit property after the\n   death of Kachra Bai as successor.           Against that judgment\n   defendant Munni Bai has preferred appeal before the first\n   appellate Court under\nSection 96\nof the CPC contending that the\n   judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court is against\n   the materials on record, the learned trial Court has committed\n   illegality in not giving due consideration on the documents Ex. D/1\n   and D/2. The defendants are in possession of the suit property for\n   the last 12 years which was in the knowledge of the plaintiff as\n   such they have acquired the right on principle of adverse\n   possession, still this fact has not been taken into consideration by\n   the learned trial Court, therefore, the judgment and decree\n   deserves to be set aside.\n13. Learned first appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated\n   27.01.2009 dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment and\n   decree passed by the learned trial Court. The first appellate Court\n   has recorded its finding that since the partition has already been\n7\ndone as such subsequent partition cannot be done but the share\n   of Punau which was inherited to Kachra Bai and defendants No. 1\n   and 2 are jointly doing agricultural operation therefore, principle of\n   adverse possession is not applicable. The finding has also been\n   recorded by the First Appellate Court that as per\nSection 14\nof the\n   Hindu Succession Act after death of her husband Kachra Bai has\n   absolute title over the suit property and she has not waived it,\n   died issueless, therefore, this property cannot be inherited by\n   defendants No. 1 and 2 jointly as they are not the only\n   successors. As per\nSection 15\nand\n16\nof the Hindu Succession\n   Act, all the legal heirs are entitled to inherit the property,\n   therefore, the trial Court has rightly passed the judgment and\n   decree and dismissed the appeal. Aggrieved by this judgment and\n   decree passed by the first appellate Court, the defendant No. 2\n   Jhunni Bai has preferred this second appeal.\n14. While admitting the appeal this Court has framed afore stated\n   substantial question of law on 05.07.2021. Even after admitting\n   the appeal, this Court has directed for issuance of notice to the\n   respondents. In pursuance of order, notice was served to\n   respondents No. 2 and 3. Respondent No. 4 and Respondent No.\n   5 unserved as expired. The appellant moved an application for\n   deleting the name of Respondent No. 5 which was allowed by this\n   Court on 04.01.2021. Notice to respondent No. 1 was unserved\n   as he had left the village, therefore, the notice was effected\n   through paper publication vide order dated 04.01.2021 and in\n   pursuance of the order appellant has got published notice in\n   Dainikbhaskar on 06.01.2021 directing the respondent No. 1 to\n   appear on 11.02.2021, despite this service of notice respondents\n   No. 1, 2 and 3 have chosen not to appear before this Court.\n15. Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 would submit that both\n   the Courts below have not appreciated the evidence, materials on\n   record while treating Ex.D1 and Ex.D2 to be inadmissible in\n   evidence ignoring the settled position of law, provisions of the\nRegistration Act\nand\nSection 6\nof the Transfer of Property Act.\n   This is apparent mistake of law as such substantial question of\n   law framed by this court deserves to be answered in favour of the\n   defendants. He would further submit that since through Ex.D1\n8\nand Ex.D2 the plaintiffs have waived their right, therefore, they\n   have no right over the share of the property and the learned court\n   below should have dismissed the suit filed by the plaintiffs.\n16. The controversy raised in this appeal move around the\nSection 17\nof the Registration Act,1908 which provides which document\n   requires compulsory registration and whether Ex.D1 and. Ex.D2\n   fall in this category or not, therefore, it is expedient for this court\n   to extract the\nSection 17\nof the Act which reads as under:-\nSection 17\nin\nThe Registration Act\n, 1908\n17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.--(l) The\n       following documents shall be registered, if the property to\n       which they relate is situate in a district in which, and if they\n       have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No.\n       XVI of 1864, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1866\n, or the\nIndian\n       Registration Act, 1871\n, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1877\n, or\n       this Act came or comes into force, namely:--\n(a) instruments of gift of immovable property;\n(b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or\n       operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether\n       in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether\n       vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and\n       upwards, to or in immovable property;\n(c) non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the\n       receipt or payment of any consideration on account of the\n       creation, declaration, assignment, limitation or extinction of\n       any such right, title or interest; and\n(d) leases of immovable property from year to year, or for any\n       term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\n(e) non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning\n       any decree or order of a Court or any award when such\n       decree or order or award purports or operates to create,\n       declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in\n       future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent,\n       of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in\n       immovable property:\n(2) Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (l) applies to\n--\n(i) any composition deed; or\n(ii) any instrument relating to shares in a joint stock Company,\n       notwithstanding that the assets of such Company consist in\n       whole or in part of immovable property; or\n(iii) any debenture issued by any such Company and not\n       creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing any\n       right, title or interest, to or in immovable property except in so\n       far as it entitles the holder to the security afforded by a\n       registered instrument whereby the Company has mortgaged,\n       conveyed or otherwise transferred the whole or part of its\n       immovable property or any interest therein to trustees upon\n       trust for the benefit of the holders of such debentures; or\n(iv) any endorsement upon or transfer of any debenture\n9\nissued by any such Company; or\n(v) Any document other than the documents specified in sub-\nsection (1A)] not itself creating, declaring, assigning, limiting\n               or extinguishing any right, title or interest of the value of one\n               hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable property, but\n               merely creating a right to obtain another document which will,\n               when executed, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any\n               such right, title or interest; or\n(vi) any decree or order of a Court [except a decree or order\n               expressed to be made on a compromise and comprising\n               immovable property other than that which is the subject-\n               matter of the suit or proceeding; or\n(vii) any grant of immovable property by Government; or\n(viii) any instrument of partition made by a Revenue-Officer; or\n(ix) any order granting a loan or instrument of collateral\n               security granted under the Land Improvement Act, 1871, or\n               the Land Improvement Loans Act, 1883; or\n(x) any order granting a loan under the Agriculturists, Loans\n               Act, 1884, or instrument for securing the repayment of a loan\n               made under that Act; or\n(xi) any endorsement on a mortgage-deed acknowledging the\n               payment of the whole or any part of the mortgage-money, and\n               any other receipt for payment of money due under a mortgage\n               when the receipt does not purport to extinguish the mortgage;\n               or\n(xii) any certificate of sale granted to the purchaser of any\n               property sold by public auction by a Civil or Revenue-Officer.\n(3) Authorities to adopt a son, executed after the 1st day of\n               January, 1872, and not conferred by a will, shall also be\n               registered.\"\nFor better understanding Ex.

Learned counsel for the defendant No. 2 would submit that from\n    bare perusal of Ex.D1 it is an unregistered family arrangement\n    and there was corroborative evidence explaining the nature of\n    arrangement arrived at between the parties as mentioned in\n    Ex.D2. he would further submit that conduct of the plaintiffs' father\n    in receiving the money from defendants' father and family in lieu\n    of relinquishment of their interest in family property would clearly\n    show that plaintiffs' father in furtherance of family partition has\n    republished his share through Ikrarnama Ex.D/2. It has been\n    further submitted that oral evidence was also brought on record to\n    this effect, as such it is clearly established that plaintiffs' father\n    has relinquished his share. The learned appellate Court as well\n    as the trial Court have committed material illegality in not giving\n    any consideration to Ex.D1 and Ex.D2. He would further submit\n11\nthat Learned trial Court despite recording a finding with regard to\n           issue No. 3 \"D;k oknh x.k ,oa muds firk }kjk okn Hkwfe dk gd NksM+ laca/kh\n           bdjkj ukek izfroknh dza0 1 ,oa 2 ds i{k esa fu\"ikfnr fd;k x;k Fkk \\ ;fn gka rks\n           izHkkoA that has given a finding that the joint Hindu family property\n           has already been partitioned and plaintiffs have already sold their\n           share but it has not been proved that relinquishment agreement\n           has been executed.\nThe learned trial Court has not given any\n           reason why the relinquishment agreement has not been proved\n           despite ample evidence brought on record. This is perverse\n           finding of the trial Court. He would further submit that the learned\n           first appellate court while examining the validity of the Ex.D1 and\n           Ex. D2 has recorded a finding that Ex.D2 is not registered\n           document, this finding is incorrect application of law as from the\n           bare perusal of Ex. D/1 it is evident that it cannot be construed as\n           document containing term of recital of family arrangement but\n           only memorandum of family arrangement. He would rely upon\n           judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nRavinder Kaur\n           Grewal and Others vs. Manjit Kaur and Others\n1.\nHe would\n           further relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case\n           of\nK. Arumuga Velaiah vs. P.R. Ramasamy and Others\ndecided on 27.01.2022 in Civil Appeal No. 2564 of 2012 and\n           would submit that the judgment passed by the learned trial Court\n           and affirmed by the appellate Court deserves to be set aside.\n18. Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nK. Arumuga Velaiah\n(supra)\n           has held as under :-\n\"18. The following undisputed facts may be noted:-\n(a) The relationship between the parties is not in dispute.\nPeriyaiya Servai through his first wife had begotten the first\n                defendant, P.R. Ramaswamy and through his second wife had\n                two sons, namely, P.R. Kasilingam second defendant and late\n                Marimuthu. The appellantplaintiff is the son of P.R.\n                Kasilingam.\n(b) Appellant has also claimed that his grandfather Periyaiya\n                Servai had executed a will in his favour and therefore he had\n                onefourth share in the suit property.\n(c) It is also not in dispute that O.S. No. 347 of 1991 was filed\n                on the file of the District Munsiff Court, Devakottai by\n1   (2020) 9 SCC 706\n12\nPeriyaiya Servai for declaration of title and permanent\n       injunction, wherein all the suit properties had been shown as\n       joint family properties. Against the dismissal of the said suit a\n       preliminary decree was passed granting onefourth share to\n       the plaintiff therein in A.S. No. 37 of 1993 preferred against\n       the dismissal of the suit.\n(d) In A.S. No. 37 of 1993 it was held that the suit properties\n       were joint family properties and in the year 1964 there was a\n       partition between the members of the joint family. The said\n       judgment was not assailed by any of the parties.\n(e) However, the appellant herein instituted a fresh suit being\n       O.S. No. 101 of 2004 on the file of the District Munsiff Court,\n       Devakottai which was dismissed, against which A.S. No.\n       38/2005 was filed before the Subordinate Judge, Devakottai\n       wherein it was observed that the finding given in A.S. No. 37\n       of 1993 to the effect that there was a partition in the family in\n       the year 1964, had attained finality.\n(f) Aggrieved by the dismissal of the appeal, second appeal\n       being S.A. No. 92 of 2007 was filed before the Madurai Bench\n       of the Madras High Court, which has also dismissed the same\n       by the impugned judgment.\n24. Having regard to the aforesaid provisions of law it can be safely\n    concluded that the said award was a mere arrangement to divide\n    the properties in future by metes and bounds as distinguished\n    from an actual deed of partition under which there is not only a\n    severance of status but also division of joint family properties by\n    metes and bounds in specific properties. Hence it was exempted\n    from registration under\nSection 17 (2) (v)\nof the Act. A document\n    of partition which provides for effectuating a division of properties\n    in future would be exempt from registration under\nsection 17 (2)\n(v). The test in such a case is whether the document itself creates\n    an interest in a specific immovable property or merely creates a\n    right to obtain another document of title. If a document does not\n    by itself create a right or interest in immovable property, but\n    merely creates a right to obtain another document, which will,\n    when executed create a right in the person claiming relief, the\n    former document does not require registration and is accordingly\n    admissible in evidence vide Ranjangam Iyer v. Ranjangam Iyer,\n    AIR 1922 PC 266.\"\n19. From the aforestated legal position and material brought on\n    record it is crystal clear that both the courts below have\n    committed illegality in not considering Ex. D/1 and D/2 as if it is\n    document of partition which provide for effective division of\n    property in future, therefore it is not required to be registered\n    under\nSection 17(2)(V)\nof the Registration Act. Learned Courts\n    below have also not applied the test which is required to see\n13\nwhether the documents shall be registered if the document itself\ndoes not create right of interest over immovable property but\nmerely creates right to obtain other documents when executed\ncreates right to the person claiming relief. Formal document does\nnot require registration, it is admissible in evidence. Ex.D/1 is of\nthe nature of memorandum of understanding, mere agreement for\nsteps to be taken in future for division of property. Therefore, the\nsubstantial question of law framed by this Court is answered in\nfavour of the appellant but learned trial Court while allowing the\nsuit on part has taken into consideration that plaintiff had\namended its pleading and para 6A has been inserted wherein the\nplaintiffs have pleaded that in case if the court finds that partition\nhas been taken place then also they are entitled for half of the\nshare which is share of the deceased Kachra Bai as they are also\nlegal representative of Kachra Bai. The defendants have not\ncontroverted this averment in the written statement. The learned\ntrial Court while recording a finding that Kachra Bai is widow of\nPunau and she was inherited half of the property of her husband\nand as per\nSection 15\nof the Hindu Succession Act property will\nbe inherited by the legal heirs of husband. Since, the plaintiffs and\ndefendants No. 1 and 2 are the legal heirs of the deceased Punau\ntherefore, they are entitled to succeed the property inherited by\nKachra Bai in equal shares. As such, the plaintiffs and defendants\nNo. 1 and 2 are entitled to get 1/4 th share of the property. It is\npertinent to mention here that even Ex.D1 and D2 do not make\nrecital about the partition of the property inherited by Kachra Bai\nafter her death as she was issue less, therefore, the property\ninherited by her will be governed by provisions of\nSection 14\nto\n16\nof the Hindu Succession Act which are extracted below:-\n\"14. Property of a female Hindu to be her absolute property-\n(1) Any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether\n          acquired before or after the commencement of this Act,\n          shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a\n          limited owner. Explanation.--In this sub-section,\n          \"property\" includes both movable and immovable\n          property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or\n          devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or\n          arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person,\n          whether a relative or not, before, at or after her\n14\nmarriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase\n         or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever,\n         and also any such property held by her as stridhana\n         immediately before the commencement of this Act.\n(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any\n         property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any\n         other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil\n         court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will\n         or other instrument or the decree, order or award\n         prescribe a restricted estate in such property.\n15.

Order of succession and manner of distribution among\n   heirs of a female Hindu.--The order of succession among\n   the heirs referred to in\nsection 15\nshall be, and the distribution\n   of the intestates property among those heirs shall take place\n   according to the following rules, namely:--\nRule 1.--Among the heirs specified in sub-section (1) of\nsection 15\n, those in one entry shall be preferred to\n        those in any succeeding entry and those included in the\n        same entry shall take simultaneously.\nRule 2.--If any son or daughter of the intestate had pre-\n        deceased the intestate leaving his or her own children\n        alive at the time of the intestate's death, the children of\n        such son or daughter shall take between them the\n15\nshare which such son or daughter would have taken if\n         living at the intestate's death.\nRule 3.--The devolution of the property of the intestate on\n        the heirs referred to in clauses (b), (d) and (e) of sub-\n        section (1) and in sub-section (2) to\nsection 15\nshall be\n        in the same order and according to the same rules as\n        would have applied if the property had been the father's\n        or the mother's or the husband's as the case may be,\n        and such person had died intestate in respect thereof\n        immediately after the intestate's death.\"\n20. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its recent judgment in case of\nArunachala Gounder (Dead) By Lrs vs Ponnusamy\nin\n   Civil Appeal No. 6659/2011 dated 20.01.2022                  has\n   examined the provisions of\nSection 14\n,\n15\nand\n16\nof the Act.\n   The relevant para is extracted below:-\n\"75. This Court while analysing the provisions of\nSections 15\n&\n16\nof the Act in the case of\nState of Punjab Vs.\n          Balwant Singh & Ors.\n15, has held as under:-\n\"7. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 15\ngroups the heirs of a\n         female intestate into five categories and they are\n         specified under clauses (a) to (e). As per\nSections 16\nRule 1 those in one clause shall be preferred to those in\n         the succeeding clauses and those included in the same\n         clause shall take simultaneously. Sub- section (2) of\nSection 15\nbegins with a non-obstante clause providing\n         that the order of succession is not that prescribed under\n         sub-section (1) of\nSection 15\n. It carves out two\n         exceptions to the general order of succes- sion\n         provided under sub-section (1). The first exception\n         relates to the property inherited by a female Hindu from\n         her father or mother. That property shall devolve, in the\n         absence of any son or daughter of the deceased\n         (including the children of the pre-deceased son or\n         daughter), not upon the other heirs referred to in sub-\n         section (1) in the order specified therein, but upon the\n         heirs of the father. The second exception is in relation to\n         the property inherited by a female Hindu from her\n         husband or from her father-in-law. That property shall\n         devolve, in the absence of any son or daughter of the\n         deceased (including the children of the pre-deceased\n         son or daughter) not upon the other heirs referred to\n         under sub-section (1) in the order specified thereunder\n         but upon the heirs of the husband.\n8. The process of identifying the heirs of the intestate\n         under sub-section (2) of\nSection 15\nhas been explained\n         in\nBhajya v. Gopikabai and Anr.\n[1978] 3 SCR 561.\n         There this Court observed that the rule under which the\n         property of the intestate would devolve is regulated by\n         Rule 3 of\nSection 16\nof the Act.\nRule 3 of Section 16\n16\nprovides that \"the devolution of the property of the\n                        intestate on the heirs referred to in clauses (b), (d) and\n(e) of sub-section (1) and in sub-section (2) of\nSection\n                        15\nshall be in the same order and according to the\n                        same rules as would have applied if the property had\n                        been the father's or the mother's or the husband's as\n                        the case may be, and such person had died intestate in\n                        respect thereof immediately after the intestate's death\".\n76. Again in the case of Bhagat Ram (dead) by LRs. Vs. Teja\n                  Singh (dead) by LRs.16, a two-Judge Bench of this Court\n                  analysing the provisions of\nSections 14\n,\n15\nand\n16\nof the Act\n                  reiterating the view taken in the\nState of Punjab Vs. Balwant\n                  Singh & Ors.(Supra\n), observed as under :-\n\"The source from which she inherits the property is\n                        always important and that would govern the situation.\n                        Otherwise persons who are not even remotely related\n                        to the person who originally held the property would\n                        acquire rights to inherit that property. That would defeat\n                        the intent and purpose of sub-\nSection 2\nof\nSection 15\n,\n                        which gives a special pattern of succession. \"\n21. From the above discussion and considering the law, it is held that\n              finding recorded by the learned trial Court, affirmed by the\n              appellate court to that extent that plaintiffs and defendants are\n              entitled to get 1/4th share is legal, justified and does not call for\n              interference but it is held that the substantial question of law\n              framed by this court is answered in favour of the appellant. Still\n              the appeal deserves to be dismissed for the reason mentioned in\n              the foregoing paragraphs.\n22. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n23. A decree be drawn up accordingly. No order as to costs.\nSd/-\n(Narendra Kumar Vyas)\n                                                              Judge\nDeshmukh",

The fact that\n\n               plaintiff        and   defendants       belong    to     Sunni    Muslim\n\n               Community is not in dispute. It is also not disputed that\n\n               Gulam Moidden Khan died in the year 1978.\n3.          The further pleading is that the property in dispute is\n\n               ancestral property of plaintiff Kutubuddin and defendant\n\n               No.-2/Yakub Khan and Must. Kallo. One                     portion of the\n\n               ancestral house shown in blue lines in the plaint map was\n\n               sold to Smt. Krishna Kumari by Gulam Moiddeen Khan\n\n               father of plaintiff and defendant No. 2 and rest of the\n\n               portion was mortgaged with Kuwar Pratap Singh Chauhan\n\n               on an amount of Rs. 3,500/-. The plaintiff after making\n\n               entire payment had freed the mortgaged property. The\n\n               plaintiff and defendant No. 2 lived together for a period of\n\n               one and half year after the death of their father and\n\n               thereafter started living separately. The              plaintiff is living\n\n               in the southern part of the disputed property at ground floor\n\n               and defendant No. 2/Yakub was living at First Floor of the\n\n               southern part of disputed property.

The\n\n               defendant No. 1 Tahir Khan was living in the southern part\n\n               of the disputed house at ground floor as a tenant and had\n\n               not paid the rent of the tenanted house. The defendant No. 2\n\n               had constructed his own home at Appa Ganj.\n4.          The further pleading is that on 31/07/1985, defendant\n\n               No. 1/Tahir Khan had told to the plaintiff that the disputed\n\n               house, in which, he is living as a tenant was sold to him by\n\n               the defendant No.-2/Yakub for a consideration of an amount\n\n               of Rs. 13,000/- vide registered        sale deed though the fact\n\n               remains that the defendant No. 2 has no right to sale the\n\n               said disputed property to the defendant No. 1 because the\n\n               partition of the disputed property has not been done,\n\n               therefore, the registered sale deed of the said disputed\n\n               property executed by the defendant No. 2 in favour of\n\n               defendant No.-1 is null and void and the same deserves to\n\n               be set aside.\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 7 )-         S.A.

The   defendant    No.-1/Tahir Khan by submitting his\n\n               written statement has denied the averments made in the\n\n               plaint. It is submitted that after partition of the disputed\n\n               property between the plaintiff and           defendant No. 2, the\n\n               property shown in red lines in the plaint map had come in\n\n               share of defendant No.-2/Yakub and on 08/01/1985, he sold\n\n               the property to this defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan which came\n\n               in his share and accordingly that part of the disputed\n\n               property          which   he   purchased   from Yakub   is   in   his\n\n               possession. The defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan had further\n\n               denied that the disputed property was mortgaged with\n\n               Kuwar Pratap and the plaintiff had freed the mortgaged\n\n               property.

It is\n\n               submitted that the partition of the disputed property\n\n               between him and the plaintiff was done and as per the\n\n               partition deed the disputed property shown in the red lines\n\n               in the plaint map has come in his share and he is in\n\n               possession of the same. He has sold the property which\n\n               came in his share to defendant No.-1/Tahir Khan. The\n\n               defendant No.-2 denied that the disputed property was\n\n               mortgaged with Kuwar Pratap and the plaintiff had freed the\n\n               mortgaged property. It was also denied that defendant\n\n               No.1/Tahir Khan was living in the disputed house in the\n\n               capacity of a tenant.\n8.

Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated\n\n               30/08/2003 passed in Civil Suit No. 102A/1998 by learned\n\n               VI Civil Judge, Class-1, District Gwalior, plaintiff has filed\n\n               a Civil Appeal bearing No. 32/2003 before the learned 3 r d\n\n               Additional District Judge, Gwalior. The defendant No. 1 has\n\n               also filed cross objections agrieved by the judgement and\n\n               decree declaring the sale-deed dated 08.01.85 as null and\n\n               void.\n11.

Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the\n\n               learned Additional District Judge has acted illegally in\n\n               dismissing the suit. It is further argued that Tahir Khan had\n\n               instituted a suit for declaration & permanent injunction on\n\n               the basis of the sale deed dated 08.01.1985. In that suit he\n\n               had pleaded that the partition between the brothers (i.e.\n\n               Kutubuddin & Yakub Khan) had taken place and Tahir Khan\n\n               had purchased the portion which was allotted to Yakub\n\n               Khan in the earlier oral partition. The stand of Kutubuddin\n\n               in the earlier suit was similar to the present one meaning\n\n               thereby that no partition had taken place and Yakub Khan\n\n               had no right to sell any specific portion without actual\n\n               partition. The plea of the appellant/Kutubuddin (since dead\n\n               and represented by LRs) found favour and the court of VIII\n\n               ADJ, Gwalior held in its judgment dated 09.08.1996 vide\n\n               Ex P-8 that the partition was not proved and Yakub Khan\n\n               had no right to sell any specific portion of the property.\n\n               This judgment & decree attained finality and is binding on\n\n               the parties on account of the principles of res-judicata.

No. 26 of 2005\nlearned ADJ has committed an illegality in passing the\n\n               impugned judgment without considering the effect of res-\n\n               judicata in the light of Ex P/8.\n13.         The further argument is that the plaintiff has produced\n\n               the municipal record up to the year 1986 vide Ex. P-4, P-5\n\n               & P-6 which goes to show that the suit property continued\n\n               to be recorded in the name of Gulam Moiddeen without\n\n               mention of the alleged oral partition.\n14.         The further submission is that the learned ADJ has\n\n               erred in overlooking the law laid down by the Apex Court in\n\n               the case of\nVidhyadhar vs Manikrao & Anr.\nreported in AIR\n\n               1999 SC 1441 that if the defendant does not choose to\n\n               appear in the witness box it will be deemed that the case of\n\n               the plaintiff is admitted to him. It is further argued that the\n\n               learned ADJ has erred in law in ignoring the settled legal\n\n               proposition that even in case of Muslim Joint Owners, a\n\n               specific portion of the property cannot be transferred by one\n\n               of them without partition. The purchaser has the only\n\n               remedy to restore the possession and institute a suit for\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 12 )-             S.A. No. 26 of 2005\npartition.\n15.         The learned ADJ has further erred in ignoring that the\n\n               registered sale deed dated 08.01.1985 is executed for more\n\n               than the share of defendant No. 2/Yakub.\n16.         It is further argued that        the impugned judgment &\n\n               decree are outcome of non reading and/or misreading of the\n\n               material, oral & documentary evidence on record. Thus, the\n\n               findings         of    the   learned ADJ       have   therefore    become\n\n               incorrect, arbitrary, illegal and perverse.\n17.         On   the     other   hand,      learned   counsel     for   the\n\n               respondents/defendants supported the impugned judgment\n\n               and decree passed by the court below and prayed for\n\n               dismissal of the instant appeal being bereft of merit and\n\n               substance.\n18.

Though, the pleadings regarding earlier judgment passed\n\n               in Civil Suit No. 172/1992 which was decided on 23/12/1992 and its\n\n               effect on the present suit are not necessary to be incorporated and the\n\n               learned court ought to have taken into consideration the effect of the\n\n               judgment contained in Ex. P/8 as the same has legal effect. However,\n\n               learned court below has not taken into consideration Ex. P/8. This\n\n               aspect has came into the notice of the counsel for the appellant on\n\n               23/08/2010, when he was placing final arguments before the Court,\n\n               hence, application for amendment in the plaint is filed because the\n\n               amendment is necessary for final adjudication between the parties.\n\n               Therefore, the amendment mentioned in para 12 of the application be\n\n               allowed to be incorporated in the plaint.

Both the above applications are filed to prove the issue of res-\n\n               judicata. The only reason for inordinate delay of 25 years in filing\n\n               these application is given that when the counsel of appellants was\n\n               preparing the arguments then it comes into notice to him that these\n\n               amendments are necessary and the documents are required to be filed.\n\n               However, the said ground can not be accepted for delay of 25 years.\n\n               The Apex court in the case of\nThe State of Punjab Vs Bua Das\n\n               Kaushal\nAIR 1971 SC 1676 held that Plea of res-judicata\n\n               is not waived if necessary facts were present in the mind of\n\n               parties and gone in to by court absence of specific plea in\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 15 )-             S.A.

Therefore, I.A.No.335/2011 and I.A. No. 334/2011 are hereby\n\n               dismissed.\n23.

It is not disputed between the parties that the property in dispute\n\n               was owned by Gulam Moiddeen Khan who was the father of the\n\n               original plaintiff/ Kutubuddin and defendant No. 2.

Devolution of inheritance :--Subject to the provisions\n                             of\nSections 39\nand\n40\n, the whole estate of a deceased\n                             Mohammedan if he has died intestate, or so much of it as has\n                             not been disposed of by will, if he has left a will (Section\n118), devolves on his heirs at the moment of his death, and\n                             the devolution is not suspended by reason merely of debts\n                             being due from the deceased (k). The heirs succeed to the\n                             estate as tenants-in-common in specific shares (1).\n44. Distribution of estate :--Since the estate devolves on the\n                             heirs at the moment of the death of the deceased, they are at\n                             liberty to divide it at any time after the death of the\n                             deceased. The distribution is not liable to be suspended until\n                             payment of the debts.\n56, Vested inheritance :--A \" vested inheritance\" is the\n                             share which vests in an heir at the moment of the ancestor's\n                             death. If the heir dies before distribution, the share of the\n                             inheritance which has vested in him will pass to such\n                             persons as are his heirs at the time of his death. The shares\n                             therefore are to be determined at each death (y). See\nSection\n                             41\nabove.\"\n29.         Thus the whole estate of a deceased Mohammedan if he has\n\n               died intestate, or so much of it as has not been disposed of by Will, if\nSignature Not Verified\nhe has left a Will, devolves on his heirs at the moment of his death,\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 18 )-              S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nand the devolution is not suspended by reason merely of debts being\n\n               due from the deceased. The heirs succeed to the estate as tenants-in-\n\n               common in specific shares. Unlike Hindu Law, estate of a deceased\n\n               Mohammedan, if he has died intestate, devolves on his heirs at the\n\n               moment of his death. Under the Mohammedan Law, birth right is not\n\n               recognized.\n30.         As per the law relating to succession in Muslims, the right of an\n\n               heir apparent or presumptive comes into existence for the first time on\n\n               the death of the ancestor, and he is not entitled until then to any\n\n               interest in the property to which he would succeed as an heir if he\n\n               survived the ancestor. There is no joint tenancy in Mohammedan law\n\n               and the heirs are only tenants-in-common. Therefore, an heir can\n\n               claim partition in respect of one of the properties held in common\n\n               without seeking partition of all the properties.\n31.         The joint system family or joint property is unknown to Muslim\n\n               law and therefore the right, title and interest in the land held by the\n\n               person stands extinguished and stands vested in other persons. As per\n\n               interpretation by Mulla on\nSec.51\nabout inheritance, there is no\n\nSignature Not distinction\n              Verified    in the Mohammedan Law of inheritance between movable\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 19 )-            S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nor immovable properties or between ancestral and self-acquired\n\n               property. There is no such thing as a Joint Mohammedan family nor\n\n               does the law recognize a tenancy in common in a Mohammedan\n\n               family. In a Mohammedan family there is a presumption that the cash\n\n               and household furniture belong to the husband.\n32.         Mohammedan law does not recognize a joint family as a legal\n\n               entity. In fact according to the rules of Mohammedan law of\n\n               Succession, heir ship does not necessarily go with membership of the\n\n               family. There are several males and females who have no interest in\n\n               the heritage but may be members of the family. On the other hand\n\n               there are several heirs like, for example, married daughters of a\n\n               deceased male owner who take an interest in the estate but are no part\n\n               of the family.\n33.         In Mohammedan Law the doctrine of partial partition is not\n\n               applicable because the heirs are tenants-in-common and the heirs of\n\n               the deceased Muslim succeed to the definite fraction of every part of\n\n               his estate. The share of heirs under Mohammedan Law are definite\n\n               and known before actual partition. Therefore on partition of properties\n\nSignature Not belonging\n              Verified         to a deceased Muslim there is division by metes and\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 20 )-             S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nbounds in accordance with the specific share of each heir being\n\n               already determined by the law.\n34.         In view of the law relating to succession in Muslims as\n\n               discussed above, now it has to be seen whether in the case in hand the\n\n               properties of Moiddeen Khan were partitioned ?\n35.         The plaintiff has examined himself as PW/1 and stated that\n\n               disputed property belonged to his father Gulam Moiddeen Khan who\n\n               died in the year 1978. After his death, he (Kutubuddin Khan) his\n\n               sister Musammat Kallo and brother Yakub Khan became the owner of\n\n               the property. There was no partition of any property in their family\n\n               and, therefore, the defendant No. 2 had no right to sale the suit\n\n               property to defendant No. 1.\n36.         Plaintiff has also examined Nasir Khan (PW-3) in support of his\n\n               case who has supported the statement of plaintiff.\n37.         The statements of plaintiff (PW-1) and Nassir Khan (PW-3)\n\n               remained unchallenged in their detailed cross-examination. In the\n\n               present case, the defendants did not appear in the witness\n\n               box and did not adduce any evidence at all. So, in the\nSignature Not Verified\nabsence\nSigned by: SANJAY\nof rebuttal evidence, there         is no     reason   to\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 21 )-             S.A.

The defendants have also\n\n               not adduced any documentary evidence to prove that the properties of\n\n               late Gulam Moiddeen Khan were ever partitioned. The plaintiff has\n\n               produced the municipal record upto the year 1986 vide Ex.\n\n               P-4, P-5 & P-6 which goes to show that the suit property\n\n               continued to be recorded in the name of Gulam Moiddeen\n\n               without mention of the alleged oral partition. Under these\n\n               circumstances when there is no evidence to prove that the properties\n\n               of Gulam Moiddeen were partitioned, the learned First Appellate\n\n               has committed serious error to hold that the properties of Gulam\n\n               Moiddeen Khan were partitioned between his children and the suit\n\n               property was given to Yakub Khan.\n38.         Learned First Appellate Court has hold that the properties were\n\n               partitioned due to separate living of plaintiff. However, the above\n\n               finding is purely based on the presumption because the separate\n\n               living does not prove the factum of partition in the family. The finding\n\n               of Learned First Appellate Court is also contrary to the provisions of\n\n               Mohammedan Law according to which the share of heirs are definite\n\nSignature Not and    known\n              Verified           before actual partition and on partition of properties\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 22 )-           S.A.

However, in this case the defendants\n\n               have utterly failed to prove the fact of partition in the family of Gulam\n\n               Moiddeen Khan as prescribed in the Mohammedan Law.\n39.         The learned First Appellate Court also ignored to consider\n\n               Exhibit P-8, the earlier judgment passed in Civil Suit No. 172/1992\n\n               which was decided on 23/12/1992 in which the               absence of\n\n               partition was already held between the parties by competent\n\n               civil court and which operates as res-judicata.\nIn the case of\nThe State of Punjab Vs Bua Das Kaushal\nAIR 1971 SC\n\n               1676 held that Plea of res-judicata is not waived if\n\n               necessary facts were present in the mind of parties and gone\n\n               in to by court absence of specific plea in written statement\n\n               and framing of specific issue of waiver is immaterial. In\n\n               this case also the original plaintiff had been cross-examined\n\n               at para 17 of his court statement by the counsel of\n\n               respondent/defendant in respect to earlier Civil Suit No.\nSignature Not 172/1992\nVerified which shows that the necessary facts in respect to earlier\nSigned by: SANJAY\nNAMDEORAO DURGEKAR\nSigning time: 15-09-2023\n06:22:40 PM\n-( 23 )-                 S.A. No. 26 of 2005\nsuit were in the mind of parties. The learned trial court also in\n\n               the judgment at para 11 specifically considered Ex. P-8 and\n\n               hold that Ex. P-8 also proved that there was no partition.\n\n               Thus Exhibit P-8 has been in the mind of the learned trial\n\n               court as well. Therefore, Exhibit P-8 is operating as res-\n\n               judicata in this case and in the light of this document i.e.\n\n               Ex. P-8 also it is proved that the properties were not\n\n               partitioned. Consequently, the learned ADJ has erred in law\n\n               in ignoring the settled legal proposition that in case of\n\n               Muslim Joint Owners, a specific portion of the property\n\n               cannot be transferred by one of them without partition.\n40.         As discussed above specific portion of the property\n\n               was sold by the original defendant No.-2/Yakub to Tahir\n\n               Khan whereas Yakub Khan had no right to sell any specific\n\n               portion without the partition by metes and bound. Therefore\n\n               sale-deed dated 08.01.1985 has rightly been declared as null\n\n               and void by the learned trial court.\n41.

But the reading of judgment of learned trial Court\n\n               indicates that the Court has rejected the prayer for recovery\n\n               of possession on various other grounds as well.\n42.         The plaintiff in his Court statement at para 12\n\n               specifically       mentioned    that   Tahir   Khan(the   original\n\n               defendant No.-1) had already left the suit premises and at\n\n               that time the sister of Tahir Khan was living in that portion\n\nSignature Not where\n              Verified      Tahir had been residing.

As per pleadings of plaintiff Tahir Khan was a tenant\n\n               in the suit premises, therefore, he can be evicted as per the\n\n               provisions of\nM.P. Accommodation Control Act\n. The suit\n\n               property is undivided; however, the rest of the co-owner had\n\n               not filed suit for eviction against Tahir Khan. The original\n\n               plaintiff/Kutubuddin, Kallo and defendant No.-2/Yakub\n\n               were the owners of the property after the death of their\n\n               father and partition had not been taken place between them\n\n               and therefore, decree for possession for any specific portion\n\n               can not be given. Therefore, even if the prayer for recovery\n\n               of possession was not time barred in the light of 'doctrine of\n\n               relation back', learned Civil Judge has not erred in\n\n               declining the relief of recovery of possession.\n44.

Ex.   P/8,   the\n\n                           judgment between the same parties is operating as res-\njudicata.\n2.    The amendment allowed in 2002 relates back to\n                           the date of institution of suit; however, learned trial\n                           court has not erred in holding that the plaintiff is not\n                           entitled for relief of possession on other grounds as\n                           discussed above.\n45.

Gupta,A.K.Gupta,S.C.\n \n\n \nHon'ble Mrs. Sunita Agarwal,J.\nBefore going to the matter of merits of the case in view of the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the parties, this Court is constrained to put on record that Sri Ajit Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner was heard at length. He had supplied seven compilations from compilation No. 1 to Compilation No. 7 containing synopsis of the case laws in addition to a written submissions in support of the oral submissions made by him in the Court. This has resulted in making the record too bulky. Each compilation contains number of judgements on each point. For example, in compilation no.2, on the question of consideration of subsequent events, he had referred to ten judgements of this Court and the Supreme Court.\nIn fact one judgement of this Court in the case of\nSaroj Kumari (deceased) and others Vs. Suresh Chand and others\nin  Writ Petition no.8017 of 2003 passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sudhir Agarwal on 20.12.2012 has been referred at two places with two different equivalent citations and by mentioning different paragraph of the same judgement giving an impression that these are two different judgements on the same point. The Court is constrained to record that this approach of the counsel is nothing but an effort either to mislead the Court or to make the record  so bulky as to make it difficult for the Court to decide the matter. Similarly on the point of \"duties of Appellate Court to discuss the reasons assigned by the Trial Court while upsetting its finding and to consider the evidence of the parties\", nineteen judgements of this Court and the Supreme Court have been given in compilation no.4. In compilation no.1, there are fourteen judgements on four different points and in compilation no.7 there are twenty seven judgements on different points. There are two other compilations i.e. compilation nos.3 and 6 which also contain four judgements, thus approximately hundred judgements have been cited by learned counsel for the petitioner in seven compilations supplied by him before oral argument in the matter had started.\nAfter the arguments were over on 05.01.2016, he again passed on a written submission in support of his oral submission citing a number of judgements in various paragraph of the written submissions.\nThis Court may note that the bulky records took lot of precious time of the Court to go through the case laws cited by the counsel and this has caused delay in delivery of the judgement.\nThis Court may further record that after going through the entire pleadings in the writ petition and also the supporting material supplied by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the nature of compilation nos.1 to 7 and written submission dated 05.01.2016 in support of oral submission, the Court would deal with each point argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner but will only refer to those judgements which it think are relevant to deal with the controversy, so as not to make the judgement too long and cumbersome.\nThis writ petition is directed against the judgement and order dated  26.05.2007 passed by Special Judge (E.C. Act), Bareilly in Rent Control Appeal 6 of 2004 (\nNand Kishore Vs. Rajesh Prasad\n). The brief facts of the case relevant to decide the controversy are:-\nThe release application under section 21(1)(a) of U.P. Act No. 13 of 1972 was filed by three brothers namely Nand Kishore, Sundar Lal, Jagdish Saran all sons of Tara Chand residents of Maarwariganj, Bareilly, for release of a godown situated in Marwariganj, Bareilly on the ground of their personal need. The need set up was for three sons of applicant no.1, 2 and 3 namely Sri Vishnu Kumar, Narendra Kumar, Dheeraj Kumar. It was categorically stated in the release application that sons of the applicants had completed their education but they could not settle in their carreer and  they want to establish a new venture for the sale of Empty Tin Cans. As a larger area was required for storage of tin cans, the godown in question was needed. It was stated that for running the business proposed by three younger members of the joint family, only an office space is available  with the landlords.\nThe godown in question exists in a house user of which was of mixed nature. At the first floor, the applicants were residing and at the ground floor a large portion was in the tenancy of the petitioner. It was further stated that the petitioner tenant already possessed a big shop at one side of the godown and the godown in question was not required by him.\nThe release application was contested on the ground that it was defective for non impleadment of the necessary party. The petitioner Rajendra Prasad had wrongly been impleaded as tenant whereas the tenancy was in the name of M/s Satish Tea Company. The application dated 10.10.1995 moved by the petitioner raising issue of maintainability of the release application was rejected vide order dated 14.07.1998 passed by the Prescribed Authority.\nIn support of the release application, the affidavits of Nand Kishore, applicant no.1, Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal, Narendra Mittal son of Nand Kishore, and Dheeraj Kumar son of Jagdish Saran were filed. Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal categorically stated in the affidavit filed on 08.12.1999 that he needed the disputed godown to establish him in an independent business as there was no other place available with him. Shri Dheeraj Mittal also averred in his affidavit that he needed the disputed accommodation for doing business of sale of empty tin Can.\nIn the counter affidavit filed by the tenant Rajendra Prasad, a stand was taken that the release application was malafide, it could not be maintained as M/s Satish Tea Company was the tenant. As the tenant refused to accept the illegal demand of the landlords for enhancement of rent and, therefore, they filed the release application based on a concocted story.  It was further stated that two Daal Mills were being run by the applicants, one Mill manufacturing Bhoora, Kulia was also being run in Bareilly. This apart two other firms namely M/s Ram Swaroop Tara Chand Marwariganj, Bareilly and M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal, Marwariganj, Bareilly were owned by different set of partners being the members of a joint family. The building in question is residential in nature and no commercial activity could be permitted. The applicant's sons were not sitting idle rather they were already engaged in two firms mentioned above. There are other accommodation in possession of the large joint family of the applicants wherein their sons could be accommodated. He also raised a doubt on the willingness shown by the applicants to start a business of sale and purchase of empty tins that too near a residential portion of the family in the building. In the crux, his submission was that the applicants landlord were men of means, they had sufficient sources and place to establish their sons who may also join the joint family business, they had voluminous wealth and none of them were unemployed.\nIn the written statement filed on 13.09.1999 it was stated by the tenant that the landlord had purchased a plot of measuring 800 square yards in Deshmeshnagar, Mohalla Madhobari, Bareilly within the limits of Nagar Nigam, Bareilly. They had recently constructed a shop and godown while the remaining land was lying vacant at the disposal of the landlords. Had the landlords needed the space for business they would not have left the said plot vacant.\nIn replication, it was stated by the applicants-landlords that the property/plot mentioned in paragraph no.9-A of the written statement filed on 13.09.1999 was a property which was purchased by Tara Chand, the applicant's father in the year 1959. There were five co-owners of this property comprising of four sons and five daughters of Tara Chand. In one portion of this property, Smt. Kamlesh Kumari wife of Sri Sushil Kumar had constructed her residential house and was using  another portion being a shop to meet her daily need. It was also stated that the said property was situated at the distance of approximately 1200 meters from the disputed property and moreover, the said area was predominantly residential in nature. It was further stated that the open land could not be used for godown purpose.\nThe petitioner in another affidavit filed on 06.11.2003 reiterated the fact of alternative land of 800 square yard in Deshmeshnagar being in possession of the landlord. The petitioner then moved an application on 14.08.2000 with the prayer to appoint an Amin Commissioner to inspect the properties namely Daal mills, the plot at Deshmeshnagar, the building no. 16, Marwariganj, Bareilly and building No.18, Marwariganj, Bareilly in possession of the landlords and tenants to ascertain the vacant area and the tenanted portion. This application was rejected on 02.09.2000 on the ground that it was moved with a view to delay the disposal of the release matters sufficient evidences were already on record and in view of the affidavits filed by the parties, matter can be decided.\nThe records further indicates that several applications one after the other were moved by the petitioner on different grounds which were finally rejected and the dates 25.03.2004 and 31.03.2004 were fixed for final argument.\nThe Prescribed  authority vide judgement and order dated 16.04.2004 rejected the release application with the reasoning that the applicant's sons namely Dheeraj Kumar, Vishnu Kumar and Narendra Kumar whose need was set up in the release application were found engaged in the joint family business run by the partnership firms namely M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal. It was also recorded that the applicant's family was a joint  family and all in the family were engaged in vast business ventures owned by the family, therefore, the need set up for independent business of three sons was not genuine. On comparative hardship, the affidavit of applicants paper no.76 was considered and rejected on the ground that no documentary evidence was produced in support thereof. The disputed godown was being used by the tenant for his tea business.\nIn appeal, the Court below after consideration of the pleading of the parties and the material on record found that indisputably the applicant's family was a joint family and they had joint business. The contention of the tenant that the need of the members of the joint family had to be determined  looking to the requirement of the joint family and the joint family business which they were already carrying on was also noted. It was discussed that in the firm namely M/s Ram Swaroop Tara Chand, three appellants namely Nand Kishore, Sundar Lal, Jagdish Saran were partners.  In another firm M/s Tara Chand Sunder Lal, Smt. Tara Mani wife of Sundar Lal, Smt. Siromati wife of Nand Kishore and Vivek Kumar son of Nand Kishore were partners. There was one residential accommodation namely house no. 23 Marwariganj, Bareilly. The disputed godown is situated in house no.16, Marwariganj, Bareilly. The ¼ portion of the said house No. 16 was in the share of one brother Ram Gopal who had let out it to one Mangli Ram. The portion which was earlier occupied as PCF godown came in possession of the appellants after release and was being used for residential purposes. At the first floor of the said house no.16 Marwariganj, the family of appellant no.2 was residing and the remaining portion was being used for storage of Daal etc. Fourth property at Dasmeshnagar, Bareilly was an open piece of land which was owned by seven co-sharers and in a portion whereof, residential house had been constructed by one of the co-sharer. Fifth property at 17 Madhobari, Bareilly was an open land of 300 Square meter purchased on 28.06.2001 there existed only gates and a dilapidated building. Sixth property was a shop at Shyamganj which was taken on rent by the appellants for keeping the raw material and manufactured goods of the firm M/s Tara Chand Sundar Lal. There was no accommodation suitable for the business proposed by the landlord.\nThe lower appellate Court after having discussed each property in detail came to the conclusion that looking to the  large number of members of the family and the fact that three adult members of the  family want to establish themselves in an independent business and that they filed their affidavits paper no.77-A, 78-A, 79-A, the release application could not have been rejected by the Prescribed Authority on the ground that the applicants sons were engaged in the joint family business. It was also recorded that none of the applicants/sons were partner in the two firms named above. Merely because they were involved/engaged in the family business as a stop gap arrangement their need cannot but be bonafide.\nIt was also recorded that the properties which were in possession of the landlord were not suitable for the business of Tin Can proposed by them. Three adult members of the family were competent to start their business.\nOn comparative hardship, it was recorded that the disputed accommodation was a godown. Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Ram Gulam Gupta Vs. Additional District Judge, Kanpur and others1, it was held by the lower Appellate Court that the godown can be shifted easily at any other place as no goodwill was attached to the building/place. It was also recorded that looking to the pleadings of the parties the tenant would not suffer any hardship in  case, he was asked to leave the godown.\nHaving discussed the release application on both points of bonafide need and comparative hardship it was held that the need set up by the landlords in the release application was not only genuine but pressing. The release application was wrongly rejected by the Prescribed Authority and was liable to be allowed.\nChallenging the release order passed by the lower appellate Court, the submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner are as under:-\n1.\tThe release application has become infructuous as bonafide need set up by the landlord had eclipsed on account of subsequent events taken place during the pendency of the application. The original applicants had died and their sons whose need was set up have engaged themselves in joint family business. Their need to start a new venture of sale of empty tin now does not exist.\n2. Other accommodations are available with the landlord details of which have been given in different paragraphs of the writ petition as well as supplementary affidavit filed before this Court. These alternative premises in possession of the landlords are not denied.\n3.\tM/s Satish Tea Company and wife of the petitioner are the tenants. The petitioner has wrongly been impleaded as tenant.\n4.\tThe tenanted accommodation namely the godown was initially let out at the rent of Rs.4000 per annum but now the rent has been enhanced by this Court to Rs.10,000/- per month i.e. one lac twenty thousand per annum. Thus, on account of said enhancement, the premises has gone out of the purview of the Rent Control Act (U.P. Act No.13 of 1972).\n5.\tThe need set up in the release application was for Narendra Kumar son of application No.1, Vishnu Kumar son of applicant no.2 and Dheeraj Kumar son of applicant no.3, their need has vanished on account of subsequent event of the death of the applicants/landlords.\n6.\tBy means of the supplementary affidavit dated 18.01.2015, the petitioner submitted that a partition has been arrived between the joint family members with regard to the joint family business and the properties owned by joint Hindu family. As a result of the said partition, disputed property namely, the godown situated in house no.18, Marwariganj, Bareilly has fallen in the share of three sons of late Sundar lal namely Vivek Kumar, Vishnu Mittal and Mukesh Mittal. Vivek Kumar has started a firm in October, 2014 in the nomenclature of M/s Sunder Lal Vivek Kumar and running the business of the firm. He has also opened an office and godown in the same building namely house no.16, Marwariganj, Bareilly adjacent to the property in question. He also opened a godown in two big rooms and is running his office in one room relating to Daal mill business in the same building. On the said basis, it is stated that the need of landlords set up in the release application has vanished.\n7.\tSri Vishnu Kumar has never contested the proceeding before this Court, the reply namely the counter affidavit to the writ petition has been filed by Narendra Mittal only on behalf of the respondent no.1 to 4.\n8.\tThe landlords were under obligation to disclose the accommodation in their possession but they had intentionally not done so and this fact would lead to an assumption of non-existence of bonafide need of the landlords.\n9.\tThe question of hardship was to be considered strictly in terms of the provision of section 21 (1) (a) read with Rule 16 of U.P. Act no.13 of 1972 which has not been considered by the Appellate Authority, this fact itself vitiates the order passed by it.\n10.\tThe Rent Control Legislation is for the benefit of the tenant. It is for the landlord to establish his bonafide need which must be real and compelling. If not actual and genuine, the release application needs to be rejected, being a mere desire. Subsequent need cannot be considered.\n11.\tThe Appellate Court without reversing the findings of the trial Court has allowed the release application ignoring the evidence of the petitioner.\nAt the cost of repetition it is noted that in support of these submissions, compilation no.1 to compilation no. 7 have been supplied by the learned counsel for the petitioner wherein more than 100 rulings have been referred on the points noted above. Further in the written submission passed on in support of the oral submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner more than twenty case laws have been mentioned. It is not possible for the court to deal with each judgement on the law point placed by the learned counsel. And further this Court does not find it relevant to discuss each and every case law relied upon by the learned counsel with a view not to burden this judgement. It may also be noteworthy that some of the judgment are not relevant for the facts of the present case.\nNow dealing with the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner.\nFirst submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is regarding applicability of the Act on account of enhancement of rent by this Court, this submission is misconceived in as much as the rent has been enhanced by this Court under an interim order dated 19.07.2007 as a condition to stay the eviction of the petitioner-tenant. The tenant namely the petitioner at the time of hearing on the stay application had offered Rs.10,000/- per month as compensation for the use and occupation of the godown from the month of July, 2007. The petitioner has already been evicted by the Appellate Court, however, the condition put in the interim order to save the petitioner from eviction during the pendency of the writ petition would not mean that the rent of the premises has been enhanced under the provisions of the Act which would result in the premises to go out of the purview of the\nRent Control Act\n' 1972.\nThe second submission is with reference to the events occurred during the pendency of the present petition.\nThe subsequent events which have been brought to the knowledge of the Court is that out of the three applicants/landlords, Sri Nand Kishore, and Sunder lal had expired. They are succeeded by their sons namely Narendra Mittal, Vivek Kumar, Vishnu Mittal, Mukesh Mittal and Smt. Taramani (wife) and daughter Smt. Saroj Agarwal. It is stated that the accommodation in question was required by Vishnu Mittal son of late Shri Sunder Lal, but no counter affidavit has been filed by him till date. The petitioner has brought the subsequent events before this Court by means of supplementary affidavits. In the second supplementary affidavit dated 18.01.2015, it has been stated in paragraph no.4 that the property in question has been settled with Sri Vivek Kumar, Sri Visnhu Mittal, Vishnu Kumar and Sri Mukesh Mittal and thus the counter affidavit of Sri Narendra Mittal who has no concern with the property in question cannot be treated to dispute the averments in the writ petition. Narendra Mittal who has nothing to do with the property in question cannot continue to oppose the writ petition on behalf of all the landlords/respondents. Under\nsection 58\nof the Evidence Act, nothing remains to be adjudicated because the factum of vanishing the need of the landlord is already admitted, in reply to the supplementary affidavits filed by the respondent.\nThe only affidavit filed by Narendra Mittal is neither on behalf of Sundar Lal nor for Jagish Saran nor for Vishnu Mittal and thus is not on behalf of heirs of Sunder Lal. This Court has no option but to dismiss the release application as having become infructuous.\nThe applicants are worthy people having movable and immovable property in abundance, they own highly lucrative business, there is a big building at Marwariganj, Bareilly in which the business under the name and style of M/s Tara Chand Ram Swarup is being run. In another premises at Deshmeshnagar in the city of Bareilly, lot of space is available. One shop at Bazar Shyamganj, Bareilly is also in possession of the landlord. Another mill namely Daal manufacturing mill is being run by Vishnu Kumar son of Sundar lal.\nThus a false story has been set up by the applicants/landlords for unemployment of their sons. The properties, details of which have been given hereinabove are admitted to the landlords. The Prescribed authority after consideration of these materials rightly came to the conclusion that looking to the large joint family business, the need to set up an independent business for sons of the applicants/landlords cannot be accepted. These findings have not been reversed by the Appellate Court. The applicants/landlords did not disclose their business premises in the release application and as such it is a clear case of concealment of material facts. The need, therefore, cannot be termed as bonafide.\nConsidering these submission of learned counsel for the petitioner in the light of the evidence on record, it is relevant to note that the Appellate court has discussed in detail each and every property/business premises owned by the landlords and the business which were being run by them. There is no dispute about the fact that the business which are being run in the family are joint family business. On account of death of their father, the sons whose need has been set up started looking/managing their father's business and are not unemployed as on date. This fact is of no relevance as at the time of filing of the release application they were not engaged in the business or were employed.\nThe settled law is that the crucial date for looking to the need of the landlord is the date of filing of the petition for release. The normal rule is that the rights and obligation of the parties are to be determined as they were when the lis commenced. The only exception is that the Court is not precluded from moulding relief(s) appropriately in consideration of the subsequent events provided such events had an impact on those rights and obligations. Subsequent event may change but only if they are of such nature and dimension so as to completely vanish the need of the landlord, it can be said that the need of the applicant/landlords has eclipsed.\nIn\nRamesh Kumar Vs. Kesho Ram2\n, the then Chief Justice M.N. Venkatachalia, speaking for the bench held that where the subsequent events of fact or law which have a material bearing on the entitlement of the parties to relief or on aspect which bear on the moulding of the relief occur, the Court is not precluded from taking a \"cautious cognizance\" of the subsequent changes of fact and law to mould the  relief.\nIn\nKamleshwar Prasad Vs. Pradumanju Agarwal3\n, the Apex Court has held that even the subsequent events of death of the landlord who wanted to start a business in the tenanted premises is not sufficient to dislodge the bonafide need established by him earlier as the business in question can be carried on by his widow or any other son. It has been held that the subsequent events to over shadow the genuineness of the need must be of such nature and of such a dimension that the need propounded by the petitioning party should have been completely eclipsed by such subsequent events.\nIn paragraph no. 15 of\nGaya Prasad Vs. Pradeep Srivastava4\n, the Court has expressed its concern over long drawn judicial process which create an impact on the rights of the litigating parties. Paragraph no.16 of the said judgement are quoted below;-\n16. Of course a two-Judge Bench (K. Ramaswamy and D.P. \tWadhwa, JJ) pointed out in another case\nAnsuyaben Kantilal \tBhatt vs. Rashiklal Manilal Shah\n[1997 5 SCC 457] that the \tpendency of a lis for a record period of thirty one years has \ttransformed a middle aged landlord to advanced stage of \tgerenry and at that \tstage he could not start a new business \tventure. After lamenting over the system which caused a \twhopping delay of thirty-one years the Bench made two \tdirections. The first was that the son of the landlord who by that \ttime had four and a half years more to go for reaching the \tsuperannuation age could consider starting the business in the \ttenanted premises after retirement. The second was that in the \tmeanwhile the rent for the building would stand enhanced from \tRs.101/- to Rs.3500/- per month.\nIn Ramkubai (Smt) Deceased By Lrs.\nAnd others Vs. Hajarimal Dhokalchand Chandak,5\n, it was noticed by the Apex Court that the landlord was unemployed on the date of filing of the suit but he could not be expected to idle away the time by remaining unemployed till the case is finally decided. It took about 25 years to reach the case at the final stage. Therefore, the contractor work which was taken by the landlord, in the meanwhile, will not militate against the need set up by him for carrying on the business of Kirana.\nIn\nPratap Rai Tanwani and another Vs. Uttam Chand\nand another,6. The Apex Court while considering the contention of the appellant that the landlord's son had taken a temporary employment with Visa for a limited period and went abroad observed that while considering the bonafide need of the landlord the crucial date is the date of the petition. It has observed in paragarph no.7 and 10 as quoted below;-\n7. \tIt is a stark reality that the longer is the life of the litigation the more would be the number of developments sprouting up during the long interregnum. If a young entrepreneur decides to launch a new enterprise and on that ground he or his father seeks eviction of a tenant from the building, the proposed enterprise would not get faded out by subsequent developments during the traditional lengthy \tlongevity of the litigation. His need may get dusted, patina might stick on its surface, nonetheless the need would remain intact. All that is needed is to erase the patina and see the gloss. It is pernicious, and we may say, unjust to shut the door before an applicant just on the eve of his reaching the finale after passing through all the previous \tlevels of the litigation merely on the ground that certain \tdevelopments occurred pendente lite, because the opposite party succeeded in prolonging the matter for such unduly long period.\n10. The judicial tardiness, for which unfortunately our system has acquired notoriety, causes the lis to creep through the line for long long years from the start to the ultimate termini, is a malady afflicting the system. During this long interval many many events are bound to take place which might happen in relation to the parties as well as the subject- matter of the lis. If the cause of action is to be submerged in such subsequent events on account of the malady of the system it shatters the confidence of the litigant, despite the impairment already caused.\nConsidering the law in this regard in the background of the factual matrix of the instant case, it is evident that three sons of the applicants/landlords who were unemployed on the date of release application could not engage themselves in an independent business. Because of death of their father and that there was no other business, they joined the joint family business. Their wish to start an independent business remained a dream. In the release application, specific need of three sons of the applicants/landlords namely Vishnu Kumar @ Vishnu Mittal son of Sundar Lal, Narendra Kumar, son of Nand Kishore and Dheeraj Kumar son of Jagdish Saran was set up. These three sons of the applicants-landlords namely Vishnu Mittal, Narendra Kumar and Dheeraj Mittal had filed their own affidavits before the Prescribed Authority in the year 1999 to state that they needed the shop in question to start an independent business. Sri Narendra Kumar, one of the son of the applicant/landlord filed his affidavit in support of the need set up by the landlords. It cannot be said that since others did not file their independent affidavits before this Court in the present petition, their need had eclipsed.\nMoreover it is settled law that every adult member of the family has a right to start his own independent business. Even for expansion of the family business, the premises can be required. The partition of the joint family property,if any, took place during interregnum, long period of litigation, would again does not frustrate the need of the landlords because there are many members of the family including the respondents herein who can start their business in the disputed accommodation. Even Vishnu Kumar who is stated to have got the disputed property as a result of partition in the joint family is not precluded from starting a new venture. Thus it cannot be accepted that since the applicants/landlords are no more and their sons are carrying on the joint family business for the reason that the godown in question could not be released, the need setup in the release application to start a new venture stood satisfied or eclipsed. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner in this regard are thoroughly misconceived.\nAs far as the contention of the petitioner regarding availability of other accommodations to the landlord and  non-disclosure of the said fact in the release application, it is sufficient to note that non disclosure of all the business premises and all the residential accommodation in occupation of the applicants/landlords  i.e. members of the joint family could not be a factor relevant to reflect upon their bonafide need for the reason that according to the applicants/landlords these premises are not of such nature which would have satisfied their need and further the tenant has not been able to establish that these premises can be utilized by the landlords for the business proposed in the release application. The Appellate Court below has considered in detail each and every accommodations/business premises in possession of the landlords and recorded a categorical finding of fact that they are not sufficient to satisfy the need of the landlords set up in the release application.\nNow the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the appellate Court has not followed the procedure prescribed under law while deciding the appeal in not reversing the findings of the trial Court and the evidence on record has been ignored, its order, therefore, is illegal. To deal with the submission, it is important to note that the proceedings before the Appellate Authority are in the nature of continuation of the release proceeding. The entire evidence on record was examined by the appellate Court and after discussion on each evidence it came to the conclusion that the findings recorded by the trial Court could not be sustained. On comparative hardship a categorical finding has been recorded to the effect that since the disputed accommodation is a godown, it can be shifted elsewhere by the tenant as no good will is attached to the place as in case of retail business. Moreover, the tenant possess ample accommodation in which he can carve out a separate space for the godown. The Comparative hardship was, therefore, tilted in favour of the landlords.\nIt may also be noted that the learned counsel for the petitioner took much time of the Court to place several supplementary affidavits to state that the income from salary and interest from the joint family business in which the applicant's sons are now partner and assets of the landlords are sufficient for their need. Attention of the Court was invited to the income tax returns and other related documents.\nIn this regard it is relevant to note that this Court is not going to review the income of the parties and to examine as to whether their earning is increased during the course of long litigation to hold that their need for starting a new venture is satisfied or not. The only bone of contention of the applicants/landlords was that their sons wanted to start an independent business a new venture. Even to augment the income from the joint family business, in the opinion of the Court, the disputed accommodation can be released.\nMoreover, there is nothing on record that Vishnu Kumar s/o Sundar Lal in whose share this disputed premises came on account of the partition of the joint family property/business could start or has started a new venture as proposed by him at the time of release. As per own case of the tenant he is engaged in the same partnership business which was earlier being run by his ancestors jointly. This fact further substantiate that the need set up in the release application is still alive and the release application cannot be rejected as having became infructuous with the passage of time.\nVishnu Kumar in the affidavit filed before the Prescribed Authority had categorically submitted that he needed the disputed property to start a new business, therefore, it cannot be said that he never came forward to press his need.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has further urged that the release application was itself defective, tenancy was in the name of M/s Satish Tea Company and the petitioner was only a partner. The release application could not have been filed against him as the tenant. It is liable to be rejected for non-joinder of parties.\nThis submission does not appeal to the Court at all for the reason that the petitioner has failed to bring any material on record to prove that the tenancy was in the name  of M/s Satish Chand & Company and further that this plea was not accepted by the trial Court.\nLastly on the question of hardship, it is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that no hardship would be caused to the landlords as the landlord's business would not be affected by not collecting empty tins or keeping them at a different place owned by him. In other words what he suggested is that the proposed business could be run by keeping the empty tins at a different business premises in which other business are being run. Such a suggestion is totally ridiculous.\nFor all above noted reasons, this Court does not find any infirmity in the findings recorded by the appellate Court below and further is of the opinion that the landlords have established their bonafide need for the godown in question and in case the release application is rejected, the landlord would be deprived of starting a new venture which would cause more hardship to him in comparison to the tenant.\nIt is noted that the appellate Court has granted thirty days time to the applicant/petitioner to vacate the disputed accommodation and handover its possession. A condition was also put that the landlord would pay an amount of Rs.8000/- towards two years of rent to the tenant as a consequence of release of the commercial accommodation. The tenant was required to handover vacant peaceful possession of the disputed accommodation to the landlords. As learned counsel for the petitioner did not make a submission for extension of time and as such no further time is being granted to the petitioner. Consequently, the petitioner has to handover peaceful vacant possession of the disputed accommodation namely the godown in question to the landlords within a period of thirty days. Till the date of vacation of the disputed accommodation, up to date rent as fixed by this Court in the interim order dated 19.07.2007 shall be paid by the petitioner to the landlords.\nIn case of non compliance of any of the above conditions, the decree shall become executable forthwith.\nWith the above observations and directions, the writ petition is dismissed.\nOrder Date :- 10.8.2016\n \nHimanshu",

FOR RESPONDENT NO.3)\n\n                                This appeal coming on for admission this day, th e court passed the\n                          following:\n                                                                 ORDER\nThis second appeal has been filed under\nSection 100\nof Code of Civil\n                          Procedure, 1908, against the judgment and decree dated 01.05.2017 passed by\n                          1st Additional District Judge, Amarpatan District-Satna in Civil Appeal No.28-\n                          A/2016, arising out of judgment and decree dated 12.07.2016 passed in civil suit\n                          No.155-A/2016, by Civil Judge, Class I, Amarpatan, District - Satna.\n2.     Briefs facts of the case are that plaintiff filed a suit for declaration of\n                          title and injunction on the ground that in family partition dated 26.02.1970,\n                          plaintiff received disputed property. Hence, they are owner and in possession\n                          of the same. In the instant case, defendants have filed counter claim on the\n                          ground that on 26.02.1970, partition was affected for saving land from ceiling\n                          Act and actual partition had taken place in the year 1980. In 1980 partition,\n                          defendants received suit property. On above ground, defendants filed counter\n                          claim for declaration as well as permanent injunction.\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant submit that on 26.02.1970, partition\n                          was effected between parties for saving land from Ceiling Act and in partition\n                          dated 26.02.1970 land was also allotted in the name of minors. Actual partition\n                          had taken place between the parties in 1980 and it was oral one. In this partition,\n                          disputed property came to the share of defendants. It is also urged that in\n                          proceedings for mutation on the basis of oral partition of 1980, statements of\n                          parties were recorded and in above statements parties admitted partition of\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n3\n1980. These statements are Ex.D/1, D/8, D/12, D/13 and D/14. Trial Court has\n                          discarded above statement on the ground that concerned persons have not been\n                          examined before the Court. Therefore, in absence of their evidence before\n                          Court, statement Ex.D/8, D/12, D/13 and D/14 cannot be relied upon. It is also\n                          urged that Courts below have believed partition on 26.02.1970 whereas with\n                          respect to above partition also no one has been examined whereas parties to the\n                          partition are alive.\n4. Learned counsel for the appellants has urged that during pendency of\n                          trial defendant No.2 expired and on the basis of application filed by plaintiff,\n                          LRs of defendant No.2 were taken on record. Learned First Appellate Court\n                          has wrongly held that defendant's appeal is not maintainable because he did not\n                          implead LRs of defendant No.2 in his counter claim as party.\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that plaintiff has already\n                          impleaded LRs of defendant No.2 in the plaint and counter claim has been filed\n                          against plaintiff. Therefore, he was not required to separately implead LRs in the\n                          counter claim.\nIn this connection, learned counsel for the appellants has relied\n                          upon\nMahabir Prasad Vs. Jage Ram and Others\n, reported in 1971(1) SCC\n265.\n6. Learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that learned First\n                          Appellate Court has wrongly held that defendants appeal is not maintainable as\n\n                          defendants have filed counter claim for declaration and permanent injunction.\n                          But State has not been impleaded as a party as per Order 1 Rule 3(b)\nof CPC\n.\n                          In this connection, learned counsel for the appellants submits that defendants\n                          have filed counter claim only against plaintiff and therefore, he was not required\n                          and it was not possible for him to implead State as party in the plaint. With\n                          respect to above, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to para 13 and\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n4\n14 of Appellate Court judgment.\n7. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that findings recorded by\n                          the First Appellate Court in paras 13 and 14 with respect to non-maintainability\n                          of defendants counter claim for not impleading State as party and for not\n                          bringing on record LRs of defendant No.2 in counter claim are clearly\n                          erroneous. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that substantial questions\n                          of law, arise for determination with respect to finding recorded by Appellate\n                          Court in para 13 and 14. With respect to above, two substantial questions of\n                          law arises for determination. It is also urged that as above two findings are\n                          erroneous. Therefore, appeal be admitted for final hearing.\n8. Heard. Perused record of the case.\n9 . Learned trial Court vide judgment dated 12.07.2016 passed in RCS\n                          No. 155-A/2016 decreed plaintiff's suit and dismissed defendant's counter claim\n                          and appellate Court vide judgment dated 01.05.2017 passed in RCA No.28-\n                          A/16 dismissed defendants appeal and affirmed trial Court findings.\n10. Therefore, question arises as to when this Court can interfere with the\n                          findings of facts arrived at by the first appellate court/trial court. In this\n                          connection, I would like to refer to the law\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Apex\n                          Court in the case of Chandrabhan (Deceased) through Lrs.\nAnd Others vs.\n                          Saraswati and Others\nreported in AIR 2022 SC 4601, wherein Hon'ble\n                          Apex Court in para 33(iii) has held as under:-\n\" 3 3 (iii) The general rule is that the High Court will not\n                                      interfere with findings of facts arrived at by the courts below.\n                                      But it is not an absolute rule. Some of the well - recognized\n                                      exceptions are where (i) the courts below have ignored\n                                      material evidence or acted on no evidence; (ii) the courts have\n                                      drawn wrong inferences from proved facts by applying the law\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n5\nerroneously; or (iii) the courts have wrongly cast the burden of\n                                     proof. When we refer to \"decision\" based on no evidence\", it\n                                     not only refers to cases where there is a total dearth of\n                                     evidence, but also refers to any case, where the evidence,\n                                     taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the\n                                     finding.\"\n11. Similarly in the case of Gurnam Singh (Dead) by legal\n                          representatives and\nOthers vs. Lehna Singh (Dead\n) by legal representatives,\n                          Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-\n\"13.1.......However, in Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof\n                                     the CPC, the High Court, by impugned judgment and order has\n                                     interfered with the Judgment and Decree passed by the First\n                                     Appellate Court. While interfering with the judgment and order\n                                     passed by the first Appellate Court, it appears that while\n                                     upsetting the judgment and decree passed by the First\n                                     Appellate Court, the High Court has again appreciated the\n                                     entire evidence on record, which in exercise of powers under\nSection 100\nCPC is not permissible. While passing the\n                                     impugned judgment and order, it appears that High Court has\n                                     not at all appreciated the fact that the High Court was deciding\n                                     the Second Appeal under\nSection 100\nof the CPC and not first\n                                     appeal under\nSection 96\nof the CPC. As per the law\nlaid down\n                                     by\nthis Court in a catena of decisions, the jurisdiction of High\n                                     Court to entertain second appeal under\nSection 100\nCPC after\n                                     the 1976 Amendment, is confined only when the second appeal\n                                     involves a substantial question of law. The existence of 'a\n                                     substantial question of law' is a sine qua non for the exercise\n                                     of the jurisdiction under\nSection 100\nof the CPC.\nAs observed\n                                     and held by this Court in the case of Kondiba Dagadu Kadam\n                                     (Supra), in a second appeal under\nSection 100\nof the CPC, the\n                                     High Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the\n                                     First Appellate Court, unless it finds that the conclusions\n                                     drawn by the lower Court were erroneous being:\n(i) Contrary to the mandatory provisions\n                                              of the applicable law; OR\n(ii) Contrary to the law as pronounced by\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n6\nthe Apex Court; OR\n(iii) Based on inadmissible evidence or no\n                                      evidence\n                                   It is further observed by this Court in the aforesaid decision that\n                                  if First Appellate Court has exercised its discretion in a judicial\n                                  manner, its decision cannot be recorded as suffering from an\n                                  error either of law or of procedure requiring interference in\n                                  second appeal. It is further observed that the Trial Court could\n                                  have decided differently is not a question of law justifying\n                                  interference in second appeal\".\n12.\nIn this connection, Ishwar Dass Jain (Dead) through\nLrs vs. Sohan\n                          Lal (Dead) by LRs\nreported in (2000) 1 Supreme Court Cases 434 may also be\n                          referred to. Paras 11 and 12 of\nthe said judgment\nis relevant and is under:-\n\"11. There are two situations in which interference with\n                                      findings of fact is permissible. The first one is when material\n                                      or relevant evidence is not considered which, if considered\n                                      would have led to an opposite conclusion. This principle has\n                                      been\nlaid down in\na series of judgments of this Court in\n                                      relation to\nsection 100\nCPC after the 1976 amendment.\nIn\nDilbagrai Punjabi vs. Sharad Chandra\n[1988 Supple. SCC\n                                      710], while dealing with a Second Appeal of 1978 decided by\n                                      the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 20.8.81, L.M.Sharma, J.(as\n                                      he then was) observed that \"The Court (the first appellate\n                                      Court) is under a duty to examine the entire relevant evidence\n                                      on record and if it refuses to consider important evidence\n                                      having direct bearing on the disputed issue and the error which\n                                      arises as of a magnitude that it gives birth to a substantial\n                                      question of law, the High Court is fully authorised to set aside\n                                      the finding. This is the situation in the present case.\"\nIn that case, an admission by the defendant-tenant in the\n                                      reply notice in regard to the plaintiff's title and the description\n                                      of the plaintiff as `owner' of the property signed by the\n                                      defendant were not considered by the first appellate Court\n                                      while holding that the plaintiff had not proved his title. The\n                                      High Court interfered with the finding on the ground of non-\n                                      consideration of vital evidence and this Court affirmed\nthe said\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n7\ndecision\n. That was upheld.\nIn\nJagdish Singh vs. Nathu Singh\n[1992 (1) SCC 647], with reference to a Second Appeal of\n                                     1978 disposed of on 5.4.1991. Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then\n                                     was) held:\n\"where the findings by the Court of facts is vitiated by non-\n                                     consideration of relevant evidence or by an essentially\n                                     erroneous approach to the matter, the High Court is not\n                                     precluded from recording proper findings.\"\nAgain in\nSundra Naicka Vadiyar vs. Ramaswami Ayyar\n[1995 Suppl. (4) SCC 534], it was held that where certain\n                                     vital documents for deciding the question of possession were\n                                     ignored - such as a compromise, an order of the revenue Court\n- reliance on oral evidence was unjustified.\nIn yet another case\n                                     in\nMehrunissa vs. Visham Kumari\n[1998 (2) SCC 295] arising\n                                     out of Second appeal of 1988 decided on 15.1.1996, it was\n                                     held by Venkataswami, J. that a finding arrived at by ignoring\n                                     the second notice issued by the landlady and without noticing\n                                     that the suit was not based on earlier notices, was vitiated\n                                     finding. This was in Second Appeal of 1988 decided on\n                                     15.1.1996.\n12. The second situation in which interference with findings of\n                                     fact is permissible is where a finding has been arrived at by\n                                     the appellate Court by placing reliance on inadmissible\n                                     evidence which if it was omitted, an opposite conclusion was\n                                     possible.\nIn\nSri Chand Gupta vs. Gulzar Singh\n[1992 (1) SCC\n                                     143], it was held that the High Court was right in interfering in\n                                     Second Appeal where the lower appellate Court relied upon\n                                     an admission of a third party treating it as binding on the\n                                     defendant. The admission was inadmissible as against the\n                                     defendant. This was also a Second Appeal of 1981 disposed\n                                     of on 24.9.1985\".\n13. It is correct that Appellate Court in paras 13, 14 and 15 has held that\n                          on account of non-compliance of provision contained in Order 1 Rule 3(b)\nof\n                          CPC\n, counter claim filed by defendant is not maintainable. Further, it also held\n                          that defendants have not impleaded LRs of deceased defendant Ramsiya in\n                          counter claim. On above grounds, Appellate Court held that counter claim is\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n8\nnot maintainable.\n14. Before discussing above aspect of the matter, it would be appropriate\n                          to discuss the case on merits, as Appellate Court has dismissed defendant's\n                          counter claim on merits also and it is evident from judgement passed by First\n                          Appellate Court.\n15. Basis of defendant's counter claim is that partition dated 26.02.1970\n                          was effected between the parties just to save land from ceiling Act and actual\n                          partition took place between the parties in the year 1980.\n16. Thus, it is an admitted fact that        written partition (Ex.P/1) was\n                          effected on 26.02.1970 between the parties. Hence, no statement in Court of\n                          any witness/party required to prove the same. Therefore, questions arises as to\n                          whether any other partition took place between the parties in the year 1980. As\n                          per submissions for learned counsel for the appellant oral partition was effected\n                          between the parties in the year 1980.\n17. Perusal of the record reveals that defendants have not filed any\n                          documents, pertaining to mutation proceedings, which might have been initiated\n                          on the basis of oral partition in the year 1980. Further, defendants have also not\n                          filed any application which might have been filed before competent revenue\n                          Court for mutation in accordance with oral partition. No record of mutation, if\n                          any initiated on the basis of oral partition in the year 1980, has been filed in the\n                          case on behalf of defendants.\n18. Further, no revenue record (khasra panchshala) etc. has been filed on\n                          behalf of defendants, in which entry might have been made on the basis of\n                          order passed in pursuance of oral partition in the year 1980. Ex.D/8, D/12, D/13\n                          and D/14 are panchnama's and not statements of witnesses.\n19. I have also one through the evidence on record, in this Court's\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n9\nconsidered opinion, if evidence on record is read and assessed conjointly, then,\n                          from evidence on record, it is not established at all that any oral partition took\n                          place between the parties in the year 1980. Hence, even if it is held that\n                          defendant's counter claim is maintainable, still, then, no decree can be passed in\n                          favour of defendant.\n20. Hence, in this Court's considered opinion, no substantial questions of\n                          law, especially 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, as mentioned in appeal memo, arises for\n                          determination of this Court and no fruitful purpose would be served by\n                          admitting this appeal on proposed substantial questions of law (5.2, 5.3 and\n                          5.4) in appeal memo, it is also so because Appellate Court as well as trial Court\n                          has dismissed defendant's counter claim on merits also. Therefore, principle law\nlaid down in\nMahabir Prasad\n(supra) does not help appellants in any way.\n21. If pleadings and evidence adduced by the parties and the impugned\n                          judgment passed by the first appellate court/trial court is considered, in the\n                          light of above legal principles/legal provisions reiterated in aforesaid judgments,\n                          then, in this Court's considered opinion, the findings of facts recorded by the\n                          first appellate court/trial court are not liable to be interfered with in the\n                          instant case and it cannot be said that first appellate court/trial court has\n                          ignored any material evidence or has acted on no evidence or first appellate\n                          court/trial court has drawn wrong inferences from the proved facts etc.\n                          Further, it cannot be said that evidence taken as a whole, is not reasonably\n                          capable of supporting the findings. It can also be not said that the findings of\n                          first appellate court/trial court are based on inadmissible evidence.\n22. A perusal of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the first\n                          appellate court/trial court reveals that it is well reasoned and has been passed\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM\n10\nafter due consideration of oral as well as documentary evidence on record.\n                          Learned counsel for the appellant has failed to show that how the findings of\n                          facts recorded by the first appellate court/trial court are illegal, perverse and\n                          based on no evidence etc. The learned first appellate court/trial court has\n                          legally and rightly dealt with the issues involved in the matter and has recorded\n                          correct findings of fact.\n23. For the reasons aforesaid, I find no merit in the instant second\n                          appeal. Findings recorded by the first appellate court/trial court are fully\n                          justified by the evidence on record. Findings recorded by the first appellate\n                          court/trial court are not based on misreading or mis-appreciation of evidence\n                          nor it is shown to be illegal or perverse in any manner so as to call for\n                          interference in second appeal. No question of law, much less substantial\n                          question of law, arises for adjudication in the instant appeal. Hence, appeal is\n                          dismissed in limine.\n24. A copy of this order along with record be sent back to the first\n                          appellate court/trial court for information and its compliance.\n(ACHAL KUMAR PALIWAL)\n                                                                                  JUDGE\n                          sm\nSignature Not Verified\nSigned by: SARSWATI\nMEHRA\nSigning time: 5/24/2024\n10:09:32 AM",

Heard Ms. Rama Goel Bansal learned counsel for appellant and Sri Iqbal Ahmad for respondent.\n2. This appeal under Section 96 of Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to as\nCPC\n) has come up at the instance of defendant assailing judgment and decree dated 13.02.2004 and 26.02.2004 passed by Sri N.A. Zaidi, Additional District Judge, Court no. 4, Moradabad decreeing Original Suit no. 43 of 2003 granting permanent injunction against defendant appellant restraining from interfering in property in dispute which was in possession of plaintiff.\n3. The plaintiff Satendra Kumar Singh instituted Original Suit no. 43 of 2003 impleading Sri Amolak Singh defendant appellant as sole defendant setting up his case that property dated at the bottom of plaint was owned by late Ram Rakshpal Singh father of plaintiff in view of gift deed dated 22.02.1954 executed by Kunwar Jagannath Singh. Plaintiff's father Ram Rakshpal Singh died on 23.09.1996 leaving his widow, five sons and three daughters as legal heirs. At the time of filing suit, widow of Ram Rakshpal Singh and two sons had also died. Both these sons were unmarried at the time of death.  Three daughters of Ram Rakshpal Singh had married and were staying with in-laws, outside Moradabad City. Plaintiffs' two other elder brothers with their family were residing at Varanasi and Haridwar. In the disputed house, plaintiff was residing along with his family and in some part thereof tenants were occupying the premises. No partition in respect to disputed property, owned earlier by late Ram Rakshpal Singh, has taken place between his legal heirs and entire property therefore, was in joint ownership of plaintiff and his brothers and sisters.\n4. Defendant-appellant Amalok Singh was engaged in business of Real Estate and wants to purchase plaintiff's property under undue coercive. Defendant, an active worker of Samajwadi Party and had political resources, on 13.01.2013, came to disputed property so as to forcibly evict plaintiff and his family members and caused law and order situation therein. However, due to neighbors calling and protest defendant could not succeed in his attempt. Defendant then pressurized plaintiff to execute a registered power of attorney in respect to vacant land which is part of disputed property which was denied by plaintiff. Plaintiff's family consists of his wife and two minor children i.e. son aged about 12 years and daughter 14 years. Wife of plaintiff is a school teacher and children are also school going. Plaintiff used to visit different places in the context of his business and had serious apprehension that defendant may forcibly got possession  of property in dispute. Hence, a suit for injunction was instituted by plaintiff respondent seeking permanent injunction restraining defendant from interfering in possession of disputed property of plaintiff.\n5. Suit was contested by defendant appellant vide written statement dated 18.07.2003 wherein he admitted that property was owned by late Ram Rakshpal Singh, who had already died. Thereafter property inherited by widow and eight children of Ram Rakshpal Singh. Widow and two sons of Ram Rakshpal Singh had died but two sons before death had executed an agreement of sale in favour of defendant. It is further admitted that three daughters of Ram Rakshpal Singh had already married and two sons were staying at Varanasi and Haridwar. In paragraph 6 of written statement defendant admitted that some part of disputed property was in possession of plaintiff and some part, in possession of tenants inducted by co-owners of property. It is also admitted in para 7 of written statement that there is/was no partition in respect to property, between legal heirs of Ram Rakshpal Singh, by metes and bounds.\n6. In additional plea defendant appellant pleaded that three sons of Ram Rakshpal Singh namely Ashok Kumar Singh, Manoj Kumar Singh, Arvind Kumar Singh as also three daughters namely Smt. Kumud Singh, Smt. Ranjana Singh and Smt. Aruna Singh executed an agreement to sell their shares in disputed property in favour of defendant, his brother Bhagwant Singh, nephews Manpreet Singh and Rajkumar on 01.01.1998. After execution of aforesaid registered agreement to sell, Manoj Kumar Singh and Arvind Kumar Singh died. Both were un-married at the time of death. Even plaintiff, executed agreement to sell his own share in favour of defendant and three persons named above on 19.02.1998 which is also a registered document.\n7. Another son of Ram Rakshpal Singh, i.e. Ajeet Kumar Singh, executed sale deeds in respect to his share of disputed property in favour of defendant one on 18.04.2000 and another, of same date in favour of defendant's brothers Bhagwant Singh and both of them were given possession. Defendant and other prospective purchasers continued to persuade plaintiff and his brothers and sisters to execute sale deed to which they extended assurance and said that it will be done in future. It is said that all these facts were concealed by plaintiff. Defendant has never attempted to get possession of disputed property as alleged, forcibly, there is no cause of action, proper parties have not been impleaded and suit is liable to be dismissed.\n8. Plaintiff got the suit amended by inserting paragraph 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D, consequently additional written statement dated 21.10.2003 was filed by defendant.\n9. Plaintiff stated in newly added paragraph that on 09.06.2003 and 21.06.2003 again defendant made an attempt to forcibly posses property and also threatened plaintiff's wife in respect whereto she sought to lodge report with Police but it did not register report whereupon Senior Superintendent of Police was informed and on his instructions, Police visited the  site as a result whereof defendant and persons accompanying him, ran away. Disputed property has an area of about four thousand sq. yard. On western side building is constructed in about one thousand sq. yard of land and no part of property is in possession of defendant.\n10. Trial Court, on the basis of pleadings framed three issues which are as under:-\n^^1-\tD;k oknh iz'uxr lEifRr ds Lokeh rFkk dkfct gS ;fn gka rks izHkkoA\n(i)Whether plaintiff is owner in possession over disputed property, if yes, its effect, \n \n 2-\td;k oknh dksbZ okn dkj.k miyC/k ugha gS vkSj okn la/kkfj; ugha gSA\n(ii) Whether plaintiff has no cause of action and suit is not maintainable,\n \n 3-\tvuqrks\"k dksbZ oknh ikus dk vf/kdkjh gksA**\n(iii) Relief if any, petitioner is entitled.\n(English translation by Court)\n11. Issues 1 and 2 were taken together and answered in favour of plaintiff and against defendant-appellant. Consequently, suit was decreed and permanent injunction as prayed for was granted by impugned judgment and decreed dated 13.02.2004 and 26.02.2004.\n12. Ms. Ram Goel Bansal, learned counsel for appellant argued that there were two sale deeds executed by co-sharer of property in dispute in favour of defendant-appellant and in that view of matter he became co-sharer in property in dispute hence decree of permanent injunction could not have been granted against defendant-appellant.\n13. Learned counsel appearing for respondent, per-contra, sought to support the judgment and decree in view of findings recorded by Court below therein.\n14. The points for determination which have arisen in this appeal for its adjudication are:-\n(i) Whether defendant-appellant had status of co-sharer in property in dispute.\n(ii) Whether defendant-appellant had possession over entire or some part of property in dispute.\n(iii) Whether Trial Court was justified in passing decree of permanent injunction in property in dispute against defendant-appellant.\n15. Plaintiff's right over property in dispute as co-owner i.e. co-sharer in property in dispute is admitted. There where eight co-sharers in property in dispute i.e. Ashok Kumar Singh, Arvind Kumar Singh, Satendra Kumar Singh, Manoj Kumar Singh, Ajeet Kumar Singh, Smt. Kumud Singh, Ranjana Singh and Aruna Singh. One of the  brother, Ajeet Kumar Singh, executed two sale deed dated 18.04.2000 in respect of his share i.e. 1/8 in property in dispute in favour of defendant-appellant and his brother Bhagwant Singh. Copies of aforesaid sale deeds are Paper no. 36-Ga/13 and 36-Ga/20. Sale deeds nowhere mention that at the time of execution thereof, vendor Ajeet Kumar Singh, gave actual possession of any part of disputed property to defendant-appellant or his brother Bhagwant Singh.\n16. In the written statement, defendant-appellant has specifically admitted in para 6 that plaintiff is residing in some part of disputed property and some part is in possession of tenants of all co-sharers. It is not stated in the aforesaid paragraph of written statement that the defendant-appellant also had possession over some part of property. It is only in para 20 of written statement where reference of sale deed is made in a vague manner. It is also stated that on execution of sale deed the vendees were also given possession over property in dispute. The possession pleaded in paragraph 28 is clearly a notional one since only share in disputed property was sold by Ajeet Kumar singh for the reason that there was no partition in disputed property by metes and bounds. Only 1/8 share was sold by Sri Ajeet Kumar Singh to the defendant-appellant and his brother Bhagwant Singh. It is also not stated anywhere that vendor actually possess any or some part of property and vendees were put in possession of that part of property. No evidence has been placed before Court below or even before this Court that defendant-appellant actually got possession of any part of property. It is also admitted by defendant-appellant that different co-sharers including plaintiff respondent had executed different agreements to sell but at the time of execution of agreement to sell proposed purchasers were put in possession of property subject to agreement to sell is neither stated in the said agreements nor any evidence otherwise has come on record in this regard. Mere execution of agreement to sell does not result in transfer of ownership of property.\n17. A agreement for sale or contract for sale, by itself is not an instrument giving effect to sale of immoveable property. The title to property agreed to be sold continued to vests in the vendor, in case of agreement for sale, but in case of sale, title or property vests with purchaser. In other words an agreement for sale is an executory contract whereas sale is an executed contract. An agreement for sale does not create an interest in the proposed vendee in the suit property but only creates an enforceable right in parties. An agreement for sale of property, and promise to transfer the property convey the same meaning and effect in law. A promise to transfer property is an agreement for sale of property.\n18.\nIn\nMaung Shwe Goh Vs. Maung Inn\n, 1917(1) Bom LR 179 the Court considered\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882 and said that a contract for sale by virtue of Section 54 creates no interest in or charge upon the land.\n19. Again in\nRupchand Balmukund Aharwala Vs. Jankibai Kanhyalal\n, AIR 1926 Bom 24 the Division Bench of Bombay High Court said that an agreement executed between the parties to divide property at the expiration of litigation would not create any interest on property under the provisions of\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882. A temporary arrangement with regard to profits during litigation is nothing but a system evolved by parties amongst themselves from management of property during litigation, does not mean that it has created any right or interest in property itself.\nThe Court relied on an earlier decision of Privy Council in\nRajangam Ayyar Vs. Rajangam Ayyarta, ILR\n(1922) Mad. 373 where a document, i.e., a memorandum regarding secession of jointness of parties making a declaration that from that time forth the parties became entitled to possession and enjoyment of their properties in separate shares and further providing for execution of further deed effectuating partition would mean that document/ memorandum itself did not create or declare or assign or limit or extinguish any right or interest in the moveable property.\n20. In English Law, there is recognition of two classes of ownership, legal and equitable but this has not been recognized in Indian Law. Here the Legislature has recognized, in its wisdom, only one owner. There has been a catena of authorities including that of Privy Council in\nChhatra Kumari Devi v. Mohan Bikram Shah and Ors.\n, AIR 1931 PC 196 where it was observed that the Indian Law does not recognize legal and equitable estates.\nThe Privy Council referred to and relied on earlier decisions in J.M. Tagore Vs. G.M. Tagore (1872) IA Sup. Vol. 47 and Webb Vs. Macpherson, (1904) 31 Cal 57. The Privy Council further said that by that law there can be only one owner.\n21. It is thus evident that exposition of law is very clear that contract for sale would not make the purchaser/vendee to be owner in equity of estate so long as the sale deed is executed and registered. Mere execution of contract for sale by itself would not create any right or interest in property.\n22.\nIn\nRambaran Prosad v. Ram Mohit Hazra and Ors.\n, AIR 1967 SC 744 it was held that a contract for sale does not create any interest in property. A three Judge Bench of the Court noticed distinction in law as it was prior to enactment of\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882\nand thereafter. In para 14 of the judgment, it said, that in the case of an agreement for sale entered into, prior to passing of Act, 1882 could have resulted in creating an interest in land itself in favour of purchaser. Thereafter the Court referred to the change resulted with enactment of Act, 1882, and in para 17, said as under:\n\". . . . . a mere contract for sale of immovable property does not create any interest in the immovable property and it therefore follows that the rule of perpetuity cannot be applied to a covenant of pre-emption even though there is no time limit within which the option has to be exercised.\" (emphasis added)\n23. The Court also noticed, when agreement itself recited with that sale deed would be executed within three years, the purchaser had a right to sue for specific performance and this by itself mean that agreement for sale does not create any right or interest in property.\n24.\nIn\nJiwan Das Vs. Narain Das\n, AIR 1981 Delhi 291 a Single Judge in para 10 and 11 of the judgment following\nRambaran Prosad\n(supra) said:\n\"10. . . . . . . the law in India does not recognise any such estate.\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act in specific terms provides that a contract for sale does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. Such contract is merely a document creating a right to obtain another document in the form of sale deed to be registered in accordance with law. In other words, a contract for sale is a right created in personam and not in estate, No privity in estate can be deduced there from which can bind estate, as is the position in cases of mortgage, charge or lease. Of course, such personal right created against the vendor to obtain specific performance can ultimately bind any subsequent transferee who obtains transfer of the property with notice of the agreement of sale.\n11. Till, therefore, a decree for specific performance is obtained, the vendor or a purchaser from him is entitled to full enjoyment of the property. In fact, even if a decree for specific performance of contract is obtained, and no sale-deed is actually executed, it cannot be said that any interest in the property has passed.\"\n25.\nIn\nSujan Charan Lenka and others Vs. Smt. Pramila Mumari Mohanty and others\n, AIR 1986 Ori 74 the Court in para 7 of judgment said that a bare contract for sale of immoveable property does not create any interest in immoveable property. Referring to\nSection 54\nof Act, 1882, it says:\n\"7. . . . . . a contract for sale does not, by itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. Such contract is merely a document creating a right to obtain another document in the form of sale deed to be registered in accordance with law. In other words, a contract for sale is a right created in personam and not in estate. No privity in estate can be deduced therefrom which can bind the estate, as is the position in cases of mortgage, charge or lease. Of course, such personal right created against the vendor to obtain specific performance can ultimately bind any subsequent transferee who obtains transfer of the property with notice of the agreement of sale. Till, therefore, a decree for specific performance is obtained, the vendor or a purchaser from him is entitled to full enjoyment of the property. In fact, even if a decree for specific performance of contract is obtained, and no sale-deed is actually executed, it cannot be said that any interest in the property has passed.\"\n26. A Division Bench in Dewan and sons\nInvestments Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Delhi Development Authority\n, AIR 1997 Delhi 388 said:\n\"6. In our opinion, the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that as a result of agreement to still dated the 1st May. 1970 in respect of the properly in question, entered into between the petitioner and M/s. Goodwill India Limited, the petitioner had acquired a 'vested right' not only in the property in question bill also to claim a 'No Objection Certificate' on that basis, is devoid of substance. . . . . . .\nIn\nKanaya Ram v. Rajender Kumar\n, AIR 1985 SC 371 their Lordships of the Supreme Court have held that in cases where after oral sales mutation of lands was effected in favour of the transferees even then i.e. after the mutation of properties, no rights accrued in favour of the transferees in respect of such lands as the purported sales and the subsequent mutation based on those sales did not create any right or title in favour of the transferees as the provisions of\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act were not complied with-their being no registered sale deeds. In the present case too the agreement to sell dated the 1st May, 1970 in the absence of any registered sale deed by itself would not be sufficient to create any right or title in favour of the petitioner in respect of the property in question. The registered sale deed, admittedly, in respect of the property in question, was executed on 13-2-90 and thus the petitioners acquired a right and a title in respect of the property in question only after the execution of the registered sale deed on 13-2-90.\" (emphasis added)\n27. A person who has contracted to buy land is not the owner of any interest in the land and is, therefore, not competent to apply to set aside an execution sale of the same land.\n28. Section 54 itself says that a contract for sale does not create any interest in or charge upon such property. This is what has been noticed by this Court in Indira Fruits and General Market, Meerut Vs. Bijendra Kumar Gupta, AIR 1995 All 316.\n29. In other words, a person having an agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the property except the right of litigation on that basis. Sometimes it is also described that a contract for sale is merely a document, creating a right to obtain another document.\n30.\nIn\nImtiaz Ali Vs. Nasim Ahmed\n, AIR 1987 Del 36 it was said that in absence of a registered sale deed, nobody can call himself as owner by purchase, on the basis of agreement for sale and power of attorney executed by alleged vendor in favour of prospective purchaser cum attorney. The agreement for sale, therefore, by itself does not create any status to petitioner to enter into the shoes of owner of building in dispute.\n31. Further in the sale deeds dated 18.04.2000 it is not stated anywhere that any part in the disputed property has been sold and possession has been given to defendant-appellant. Therefore, while possession of plaintiff and some other tenants was admitted by defendant-appellants he clearly failed to prove his own possession over any part of property. It is no doubt true in law a co-sharer is supposed to have an element title and possession over property in question but if there is no partition by metes and bounds and co-sharer is not in actual possession over disputed property, he can get possession only after having partition by metes and bounds and not forcibly or by any other means not authorised by law.\n32. In view thereof, even if defendant-appellant is co-sharer in the present case, Court below has rightly decreed the suit of plaintiff-respondent granting permanent injunction that defendant-appellant shall not interfer in possession of plaintiff-respondent but we clarify hereat that this injunction is subject to further order which may be passed by any Court of competent jurisdiction, if any co-sharer including defendant-appellant brings appropriate action in law for partition of co-owned property by metes and bounds and thereafter claim possession over part of property which comes to their share.\n33. The questions no. 2 and 3 formulated above are answered against appellant which question 1 is returned in affirmative i.e. in favour of appellant.\n34. Subject to aforesaid clarification/observation, we find no merit in this appeal.\n35. It is accordingly dismissed.\nOrder Date :- 22.2.2016\n \nPravin",

Present second appeal has been instituted against the judgment and decree dated 25.2.2004, passed by Addl. District Judge/Special Judge (S.C./S.T. Act), Jhansi passed in Civil Appeal No. 95/99, Sri Karodi and Anr. v. Dasai and Anr. By the impugned judgment and decree learned appellate court dismissed the appeal of the appellants with costs.\n2. The perusal of the judgment of the court below shows that Original Suit No. 130 of 1997, Dasai v. Karodi and Anr. was instituted for declaration to the affect that the sale-deed dated 23.4.97 is null and void and liable to be cancelled. It has been alleged in the plaint that there were three brothers of the plaintiff, namely, Shyam Lal defendant No. 3, Dasai plaintiff and Brij Bhushan. That the disputed property situated at Mohalla Gudari town Ranipur Pargana Mau District Jhansi is the ancestral property of the plaintiff and his brothers. That a partition took place of the disputed house in between the plaintiff and his brothers in the month of September, 1985 and a deed dated 29.9.85 was also executed. Defendant No. 3 also put his signature on the partition deed. That all the brothers are in possession of their share according to the partition. A part of the house was delivered to the defendant No. 3 in the house. But defendant No. 3 with mala fide intention executed a sale-deed on 23.4.97 in favour of defendants No. 1 and 2 in consideration of Rs. 40,000. That defendant No. 3 was neither the owner nor in possession of the house in dispute hence he was not competent to execute the sale deed. The sale deed was void and ineffective. The defendant appellants contested the suit and filed written statement and denied the contention of the plaint. It has specifically been alleged that the house in question was never partitioned in between the plaintiff and his brothers. That a document signed by Shyam Lal is not a registered document. Hence, the partition deed is not in accordance of law and is not binding on the appellants defendants and the partition deed is a void document. Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 also filed separate written statement and he also admitted that the property in dispute was sold to defendant by the sale-deed. Both the parties produced oral as well as documentary evidence before the trial court and trial court after framing issues decreed the suit of the plaintiff-respondents and a sale-deed dated 23.4.97 executed by Shyam Lal in favour of Karodi and Pyare Lal was set aside. Being aggrieved from the judgment and decree of the trial court the appellant instituted Civil Appeal No. 95 of 1999, in the Court of District Judge and Addl. District Judge/Special Judge, Jhansi dismissed the appeal vide judgment and decree dated 25.2.2004 and against this judgment and decree of the appellate court this instant second appeal has been instituted.\n3. I have heard learned Counsel for the appellants Sri Arvlnd Srlvastava and Vivek Shandllya and Sudheer Sandilya advocate for the respondents and perused the entire material on record and as well as the judgment of the courts below.\n4. It has mainly been argued by learned Counsel for the appellant that the suit was filed for cancellation of the sale-deed dated 23.4.97. That this property in dispute was the self acquired property of Shyam Lal respondent No. 2. It is wrong to allege that the disputed property is a joint property of the parties. He also argued that the courts below placed reliance on partition deed dated 29.9.85. But this partition deed is a waste paper as is unregistered document and according to law a partition deed is required to be compulsorily registered and this partition deed is unregistered deed, hence it cannot be accepted as a partition deed at all. That the defendants appellant proved the title of the Shyam Lal that he got this property from Zamindar and thereafter he constructed the house. That this house was not the joint property of the plaintiff and his other brothers. That in view of the judgment of Allahabad High Court in AIR 1989 All 133 and AIR 1999 All 167, the document is inadmissible. He also cited judgment of High Court of Allahabad in AIR 1980 All 180 and on the basis of the judgments he argued that even for collateral purpose this unregistered partition deed cannot be relied. He cited various other judgments of this Court to supplement of his argument. That the courts below were not justified in discarding the evidence produced by the defendants to prove the title of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3. Learned Counsel for the respondent disputed the argument of learned Counsel for the appellant and further argued that in view of the partition deed dated 29.9.95 the property in dispute was joint property of plaintiff and his brothers. That for collateral purpose the partition deed is admissible. That whether the property in dispute is a Joint property or not this is a collateral purpose and for this purpose the partition deed must be relied. And the courts below considered the entire evidence and circumstances of the case and recorded a finding of fact. That in the present second appeal no substantial question of law is involved and the second appeal cannot be admitted only on the point of fact. And in support of his argument he placed reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court.\n5. I have considered the argument of learned Counsel for the parties and the facts and circumstances of the case. Udnisputedly the plaintiff respondents instituted the suit for cancellation of the sale-deed executed by Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 in favour of defendants No. 1 and 2, alleging that the property in dispute is a joint family property and defendant No. 3 alone is not competent to execute the sale-deed of the property in favour of the appellants. A material question is to be decided in this case was whether the property is a joint family property of the plaintiff and his brothers on the self acquired property of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3 and brothers of the plaintiff. And the plaintiff was required to prove that the property in dispute is a joint property of the family and to fortify the contention the respondent-plaintiff placed reliance on the partition deed dated 29.9.85. This is an undisputed fact that this partition deed is a unregistered document and this is an admitted and settled position of law that the partition deed is compulsorily registerable. If a document compulsorily registerable and the same has not been registered then no right and title will accrue in favour of the person in whose favour the documents has been executed. Both the learned Counsel for the parties agreed that unregistered deed is admissible only for limited purpose. This is admissible for collateral purpose and what is collateral purpose is also material to be decided.\nIn the present case, this is not very material to be decided that whether any right and title accrued to the parties on the basis of unregistered document regarding allocation of his share of the property. Because for that purpose the partition deed is not admissible. But whether the property is a joint property or self acquired property of Shyam Lal can be decided on the basis of this unregistered deed and it is also material to be decided whether this is a collateral purpose for which unregistered document is admissible. Learned Counsel for the respondent cited a Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in\nKale v. Deputy Director of Consolidation and Ors.\n1976 RD 355. The judgment was rendered by three Hon'ble Judges of Hon'ble Apex Court. It has been held in this judgment:\nA family arrangement being binding on the parties to the arrangement clearly operates as an estoppel so as to preclude any of the parties who have taken advantage under the agreement from revoking or challenging the same. Even if the family arrangement was not registered it could be used for a collateral purpose, namely, for the purpose of showing the nature and character of possession of the parties in pursuance of the family settlement and also for the purpose of applying the rule of estoppel which flowed from the conduct of the parties who having taken benefit under the settlement keep their mouths shut resile from the settlement.\n6. Hence, the above judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court shows that a family arrangement reduced into writing and the same was not registered is admissible for collateral purposes. And this family settlement is also relevant for relying the rule of estoppel. In view of this judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court the partition deed dated 29.9.85 is relevant to this extent that the property in dispute was partitioned in between the plaintiff and his brothers. And afterwards the parties to this agreement or deed cannot deny the factum of jointness of the property. It has not been shown by learned Counsel for the appellant that this Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court\nhas been overruled\nsubsequently. And in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court the other judgment cited by learned Counsel for the appellants are not relevant for this purpose. Learned Counsel for the appellants cited a number of rulings:\n1.\nBalkrishna Das Agarwal v. Smt. Radha Devi and Ors.\n;\n2.\nBankey Bihari v. Surya Narain\nAIR 1999 All 167 : 1998 (3) AWC 1616;\n3.\nSrinivas Krishnarao Kango v. Narayan Devji Kango and Ors.\n;\n4.\nJ.B. Sharma v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr.\n1988 (Supp) SCC 451;\n5.\nDilbagrai Punjabi v. Sharad Chandra\n1988 (Supp) SCC 710;\n6.\nBanarasi Das v. Brij Maharaja Sukhjit Singh and Anr.\n1998 (5) SC 138;\n7. Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh ; and\n8.\nNeelakantan and Ors. v. Mallika Begum\n.\nThe above judgments are of no help to the appellants.\n7. Learned Counsel for the respondents also argued that in the present appeal no substantial question of law is involved. The finding was recorded on the basis of facts and this Court in second appeal cannot interfere merely in the finding of fact. And in support of his argument cited\nChacko and Anr. v. Mahadevan\n2007 (3) CCC 335 : 2007 (4) AWC 3577 (SC). It has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court:\nIt may be mentioned that in a first appeal filed under\nSection 96\n, C.P.C., the appellate court can go into questions of fact, whereas in a second appeal filed under\nSection 100\n, C.P.C. the High Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact of the first appellate court, and it is confined only to questions of law. Hence we have to see the judgment of the first appellate court and its findings of fact....\nHence in view of the Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court the second appeal can only be admitted if any substantial question of law is involved.\nIn another judgment in\nGurdev Kaur and Ors. v. Kaki and Ors.\n, Hon'ble Apex Court held that:\nIt must be clearly understood that the legislative intention was very clear that Legislature never wanted second appeal to become \"third trial on facts\" or one more dice in the gamble.\n8. Hence in view of the judgment. of Hon'ble Apex Court the second appeal must be entertained in the circumstances when any substantial question of law is involved and as I have stated above that in the present case no substantial question of law is involved. Both the courts below recorded the finding of fact. Learned Counsel for the appellant formulated substantial question of law and I have perused these substantial question framed by the appellant's counsel and I am of the opinion that all these points are question of fact and these cannot be called as substantial question of law. It has been established from the partition arrangement dated 29.9.1985 that the property in dispute was joint property of the plaintiff and his brothers and defendant No. 3 Shyam Lal alone was not entitled to execute the sale-deed of the entire house. The share of Shyam Lal in the disputed house is only to the extent of one third. And on the basis of the sale deed the appellants can be co-sharer alongwith other brother*. These appellants stepped into the shoes of the defendant No. 3 and in the circumstances of the case the entire sale deed cannot be adjudged null and void but the sale deed is certainly effective to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal. The judgment of the appellate court is to be modified to this extent that the appellant shall be sharer in the property in dispute alongwith plaintiff and his brothers to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal and the entire sale deed cannot be adjudged as null and void because Shyam Lal is the co-sharer with plaintiff and his other brothers and the share of Shyam Lal in the disputed house was to the extent of one third share. Shyam Lal could have not executed the sale deed of entire house and as Shyam Lal has executed the sale deed of entire house hence the sale deed shall be valid to the extent of one third share. It cannot be said that on the basis of the sale deed appellant shall have no share rather the appellant shall be sharer to the extent of one third share and they can file the suit of partition of one third share.\n9. For the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that no substantial question of law is involved in this case except to this effect that the courts below cancelled the entire sale deed. Whereas the sale deed is perfectly valid to the extent of one third share of Shyam Lal defendant No. 3. With this modification the second appeal is liable to be disposed of at this stage. The second appeal is disposed of finally with the partial modification to the effect that the appellant shall be co-sharer in the property in dispute alongwith plaintiff and his other brothers to the extent of one third share of respondent No. 2.",

During life time her\n\nhusband, he had made deposits under certificates of deposit bearing\n\nNo.150254289 dated 29/08/2000 and No.150254293 dated 09/09/2000\n\nand the maturity value of which as on 29/11/2000 and on 11/12/2000\n\nwas Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- respectively. The deceased had\n\nnominated her to receive the aforesaid matured amounts in the event of\n\nhis death prior to the maturity dates and accordingly the plaintiff is\n\nshown as nominee in the defendant's records pertaining to the above\n\ntwo deposit certificates and as per letter dated 10/09/2000 to her\n\nhusband there is confirmation as to holding of deposits and the plaintiff\n\nbeing registered as nominee under Nos.2702 and 2792. That her\n\nhusband     died on 18/11/2000 prior to the maturities of the two\n\ncertificates on 29/11/2000 and 11/12/2000. After his death she is the\n\nsole nominee became legally entitle to receive from the defendant the\n\nmaturity values amounting to Rs.7,00,000/- after 29/11/2000 and\n                                     5\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nRs.8,00,000/- after 11/12/2000, as the person being nominated by the\n\ndepositor for the amounts covered by the two deposit certificates\n\ntotaling in Rs.15,00,000/-. Accordingly claim was made on the\n\ndefendant by letter dated 07/12/2000. But the defendant sent reply\n\ndated 20/12/2000 stating that \"We would be giving a value date in\n\nrespect of the renewal of matured CD and in the form of a FD in your\n\nname as per the prevalent applicable interest rates\". Having thus\n\ncommitted to converting the maturity value of the two deposit\n\ncertificates into fixed deposit in the name of plaintiff, even though she\n\nwas entitle to receive the entire amount of Rs.15,00,000/- in cash from\n\nthe defendant. The letter sent to her on 23/12/2000 accompanied with\n\nmail received from its corporate office stating that \"In continuation of\n\nour CC Mail dated 19/12/2000 you are advised to inform Surekha Devi\n\nto obtain Probate/ Letters of Administration from the competent court\n\nof authority as the nomination facility is not extendable to certificate of\n\ndeposits as per the opinion of our Advocate S. Ravi, a copy of the\n\nmailed separately\". The opinion of the bank's legal adviser refers also\n\nto the registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 of her husband, under which\n                                    6\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nshe was constituted as the residuary legatee, meaning thereby her being\n\nentitled to the total sum covered by the two deposit certificates. That\n\nafter having accepted she as the nominee and registered her as such\n\nvide letter dated 10/09/2000 addressed to the depositor by the\n\ndefendant at para No.2 of Bank advocate letter reads \"Mr. Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra has since died. Though Sampath Singh has availed\n\nnomination facility, the same is not accepted by the bank with respect\n\nto certificates of deposits\" In the face of the letter of the defendant\n\ndated 10/09/2000 addressed to the depositor informing him of\n\nregistration of plaintiff as the nominee the registration numbers being\n\n2702 and 2792 clear case of estoppel against the defendant preventing\n\nit from pleading that nomination is not accepted with respect to\n\ncertificates of deposited. Solely on acceptance of her nomination and\n\nshe being registered as the nominee, the plaintiff is entitle for entire\n\nmaturity amounts. However in addition being the residual legatee under\n\nthe registered will dated 01/07/2000, she will be entitle to receive the\n\ntotal maturity amount covered by the two deposit certificates. This was\n\nalso brought to the notice of the defendant. But the additional claim\n                                     7\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nunder WILL is also ignored vide paras No.5 and 6 of the advocate\n\nopinion dated 20/12/2000 that \"The intention of Mr. Sampath Singh\n\nBohra as to the residual estate is clearly expressed in para 19 of his\n\nWILL. He says that all movables or immovables left out, or that he\n\nmay subsequently acquire shall belong to his wife Surekhadevi, after\n\nhis life Surekha Devi is entitle to inherit the proceeds of the certificate\n\nof deposits. That considering the largeness of the amount involved, it\n\nmay be advisable to call upon Surekhadevi to obtain probate/letter of\n\nadministration before settling the claims\"\n\n\n3)    The plaintiff further submits that nomination perse would suffice\n\nfor payment of matured amount to the nominee. She cannot be\n\nexpected to spend time, energy and money for securing probate / letters\n\nof administration. Further the executant of the WILL as well as the\n\nresidual legatees being both Hindus, there is no legal compulsion for\n\nsecuring probate. The \"largeness of the amount\" is not the criteria for\n\ndemanding probate / letters of Administration from a nominee. There is\n\nno legal compulsion to produce the same and the nomination perse and\n\nin addition her being a residual legatee under her husband's registered\n                                      8\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nWILL dated 01/07/2000 should put an end to all quiblings, not at all\n\nreasonable or lawful, on the part of the defendant. For all the above\n\nreasons the legal notice dated 07/04/2001 was served on the defendant\n\nby RPAD calling upon it to settle her claim as detailed therein within\n\n15 days from the date of receipt of notice by it. The defendant not\n\nreplied to the notice inspite of lapse of more than two months. The\n\ncause of action for the suit arose on 18/11/2000 date of death of\n\nplaintiff's husband and holder of certificates of deposit with the\n\ndefendant and on 29/11/2000 and on 11/12/2000 the dates on which\n\nthe   deposits       matured   and   subsequently.   The    plaintiff   in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001 prays to decree the suit of mandatory injunction\n\nagainst the defendant directing the defendant to enforce and implement\n\nthe nomination registered in her favour with it at No.2702 and 2792\n\nvide its letter dated 10/09/2000 in relation to deposit certificates\n\nNo.1502454289 and 150254293 dated 29/08/2000 and 09/09/2000\n\nrespectively of which she is the nominee. The plaintiff prays to award\n\ncosts of the suit.\n                                     9\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n4)    The defendant No.1 filed written statement submitting that death\n\nof husband of plaintiff Sampath Singh in testate at Bangalore is\n\nundisputed and the plaintiff has been nominated as nominee is true. The\n\nplaintiff contention that she is only person legally entitle to receive the\n\nmaturity value is incorrect having regard to the nature of the deposit\n\nnamely 'Certificate of Deposit' unlike in Fixed Deposit. The certificate\n\nof Deposit is negotiable and therefore the facility of nominee becomes\n\nredundant in the case of certificate of deposit. The defendant No.1\n\nsubmits that the Manager has acknowledged the receipt of original\n\ncertificate and has only written a letter referred to at para No.5 of the\n\nplaint. The defendant No.1 admits averments made in para 6 of the\n\nplaint as correct that Head Office after consulting the advocate of the\n\ndefendant has sent the 'Mail'. In respect of contention of the plaintiff\n\nthat she was registered as nominee would not change the position of the\n\nplaintiff to any extent, the defendant No.1 submits that any registration\n\nmade against the Rules will not ensure to the benefit of the plaintiff.\n\nThere cannot be estoppel against law. The defendant No.1 denied the\n\naverments made in para No.8 of the plaint stating that nomination\n                                     10\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nfacility is not available in compulsory deposits. The defendant No.1 has\n\nnever questioned the validity or otherwise of the terms of the WILL,\n\nwhat all it wanted the plaintiff was to obtain and produce probate of the\n\nWILL of her husband. The defendant No.1 submits that plaintiff is\n\nrequired to obtain probate/letters of administration only for the reason\n\nthat the amount involved in the deposits is huge and also other legal\n\nheirs of the testator approached the defendant and started disputing the\n\nrights and claims of the plaintiff. In such circumstances defendant No.1\n\nbank with an intention to avoid itself getting entangled in future in any\n\nlegal disputes, justifiably and also appropriately regarded the plaintiff\n\nto obtain a probate for the WILL and the defendant No.1 willing to\n\nabide by the directions of the court. The defendant No.1 submits that\n\nthe defendant bank received legal notice and after plaintiff approached\n\nthe defendant bank in person she had been appraised that she has to\n\nobtain probate/ letters of administration, but no formal reply was sent.\n\nThere is no cause of action for the suit.\n\n\n5)    The defendant No.1 further submits that apart from plaintiff other\n\nheirs of Sampath Singh approached their Bank and requested not to\n                                   11\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nsettle the claim in favour of the plaintiff as they are proposing to\n\ninitiate suitable legal proceedings challenging her rights and claim. In\n\nview of disputes among the legal heirs of late Sampath Singh and also\n\ntheir rival claims, defendant No.1 being banker advised the plaintiff to\n\nobtain Probate from competent court with regard to the WILL of late\n\nSampath Singh. The defendant No.1 submits that there is no foundation\n\nin claim of plaintiff. The defendant No.1 prays to dismiss the suit of\n\nplaintiff with costs.\n\n\n6)      The defendant No.2 filed written statement. The defendant No.2\n\nadmits that plaintiff is the widow of late Sampath Singh and he passed\n\naway on 18/11/2000. He further admits that late Sampath Singh is his\n\nfather. He had deposited Rs.15,00,000/- in the defendant No.1 bank\n\nunder two Negotiable Instruments No.150254289 dated 29/08/2000\n\nand No.150254293 dated 09/09/2000. The plaintiff has suppressed\n\nmaterial particulars that these two deposits were made into the\n\ndefendant No.1 bank under Negotiable Instruments and the plaintiff is\n\nin custody of these two original documents. The defendant No.2 denied\n\nthe averments made in para No.3 of the plaint that the deceased\n                                    12\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nnominated the plaintiff to receive the aforesaid matured amounts in the\n\nevent of his death prior to the maturity dates and accordingly the\n\nplaintiff is shown as nominee pertaining to the above two deposit\n\ncertificates and as per letter dated 10/09/2000 to her husband and there\n\nis confirmation as to holding of deposits and that the plaintiff being so\n\ncalled registered as nominee under Nos.2702 and 2792 are all false.\n\nThe question of nominee does not arise in the case of Negotiable\n\nInstruments.\n\n\n7)    The defendant No.2 denied the averments made in plaint para\n\nNo.4 that consequent to death, on maturity the plaintiff has become\n\nsole nominee and became legally entitled to receive from the defendant\n\nNo.1 the maturity values amounting to Rs.7,00,000/-, after 29/11/2000\n\nand Rs.8,00,000/- after 11/12/2000 without asking any questions. The\n\nplaintiff is not entitle to receive the amounts covered by the aforesaid\n\ntwo Negotiable Instruments. Any claim made by her on the defendant\n\nNo.1 for the payment of entire amounts of Rs.15,00,000/- is untenable.\n\nThe plaintiff alone is not entitle to the said amounts in deposit with the\n\ndefendant No.1 bank. It is not proper on the part of the plaintiff to act\n                                    13\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhastily behind the back of this defendant and others. The defendant\n\nNo.2 denied that the defendant No.1 has committed to release the entire\n\namounts of Rs.15,00,000/- to the plaintiff herself. The defendant No.1\n\nhas no power or authority to do so. The defendant No.1 bank has to\n\nexercise utmost caution in admitting the claims of this nature. The bank\n\nhas no manner of right to make such commitments. The defendant No.2\n\ndenied as false that the bank has made any such suggestions or\n\ncommitments. The amount is big amount as Rs.15,00,000/-. The\n\nplaintiff is an aged person and her requirements are being taken care of\n\nby her sons including this defendant from time to time. She does not\n\nneed such heavy sum as Rs.15,00,000/- all by herself. The defendant\n\nNo.2 further denied averments of plaint at para No.6 and submits that\n\nthe bank has not committed to convert the maturity value of the two\n\ndeposits into fixed deposit in the name o he plaintiff. The bank is bound\n\nto enquire and act in a manner acceptable to all claimants. If they have\n\nreally made any commitment, temporary injunction shows that the\n\nplaintiff has got them to do so. This shows that both have colluded. The\n\ndefendant No.2 further denied the averment that the plaintiff was entitle\n                                     14\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nto receive the entire amount of Rs.15,00,000/- in cash from the bank.\n\nThe defendant No.2 submits that the plaintiff has simply made a whole\n\nmess of the entire episode without consulting this defendant who is\n\neldest son of late Sampath Singh. She perhaps wanted to hastily do all\n\nacts and get all the sums for herself. That he is son of plaintiff and\n\nplaintiff is after all residing in the same building, she was bound to\n\nconsult at him before venturing into these exercises, in any case the\n\nreply of the bank is untenable. If all the members of the family consent\n\nthe bank is bound to lease the entire amount, she is alone not entitle to\n\nreceive the amounts under the two instruments.\n\n\n8)       The defendant No.2 denied averments of plaint para No.7 in\n\nrespect of WILL alleged to have been executed by his father on\n\n01/07/2000 and denied existence of such WILL. The alleged WILL has\n\nnot been the light of the day so far. There is no question of the plaintiff\n\nbeing the residuary legatee under the alleged legatee. She cannot\n\napprobate and reprobate. At one stage she claims to be the nominee for\n\nthe two deposits and now she claims as a residuary legatee, which is\n\nfalse. The plaintiff is not entitle to receive the entire sum covered by\n                                    15\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe two instruments all for herself. The word 'residuary' does not stretch\n\nto a large sum of Rs.15,00,000/-. His father never intended to will away\n\nsuch big amount in favour of woman who does not require any money\n\nwhatsoever. He has been with his father all along and he know his\n\nmind. It is false that the plaintiff has been accepted and registered as\n\nnominee. There is no question of plaintiff being nominee to receive\n\namounts under the two negotiable instruments. The question of\n\nnomination does not arise under two Negotiable Instruments. The bank\n\nhas correctly stated that there is no question of any nomination for two\n\ninstruments in question.\n\n\n9)     The defendant No.2 further submits that in respect of averments\n\nmade at para No.8 of the plaint that solely on acceptance of her\n\nnomination and she being so called registered as the nominee, the\n\nplaintiff without any so called any demur entitled to be paid the entire\n\nmaturity amounts to which she was so called nominated by her husband\n\nand which nomination was so called accepted and registered in her\n\nname are false and untenable. The bank has clearly equivocally stated\n\nthat the amount is large enough and by no stretch of imagination the\n                                     16\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nmeaning of 'residuary' can be stretched to as large sum as\n\nRs.15,00,000/-. The nomination perse would suffice or payment           of\n\nmature amount to the nominee are untenable and denied. The question\n\nof securing probate / deeds of administration also does not arise. The\n\nnomination perse and in addition her being also called residual legatee\n\nunder the alleged will should put an end to all quiblings, not at all\n\nreasonable or lawful on the part of the bank and the defendant denied\n\nthe same as false. The defendant No.2 submits that the bank has acted\n\ncorrectly in not releasing the large sums to the plaintiff all for herself.\n\nThe cause of action is imaginary. The bank is bound to release the\n\ndeposit amounts, The cause of action does not survive only upon the\n\nplaintiff. There are other claimants also, hence the suit filed by the\n\nplaintiff in the present form is not maintainable. The plaintiff cannot\n\ninvoke the nomination when there is none. She is not entitle to the\n\nrelief of mandatory injunction. No nomination is valid in the case of\n\nNegotiable instruments. The defendant No.2 is the eldest son of the\n\nplaintiff and late Sampath Singh. After the death of Sampath Singh,\n\nthis defendant has become Kartha of the family. The defendant No.2 is\n                                     17\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nentitle to get entire sum of Rs.15,00,000/- under two negotiable\n\ninstruments. He restricts his claim to the share that may determine by\n\nthis court after taking into consideration all aspects of the case. The\n\nplaintiff is guilty of suppresio vary and suggestio falsi.\n\n\n10)       The defendant No.2 further submits that the defendant No.1\n\nbank has to be directed by this court to get the consent of all the\n\nclaimants particularly his consent. That he has filed suit in\n\nOS.No.2731/2002 against the plaintiff and others for partition and\n\nseparate possession of his share in the immovable properties and also\n\nfor a share in the sum of Rs.15,00,000/- which is the subject matter of\n\nthis suit. The present suit does not survive. The defendant No.2 prays to\n\ndismiss the suit in O.S.No.15743//2001 with costs.\n\n\n11)     The plaintiff has filed her rejoinder to the written statement of\n\ndefendants stating that she is sole and only nominee accepted by the\n\ndefendant No.1 and registered as such by defendant No.1 in its records,\n\nhence responsible and liable to pay deposited amount to her. It is no\n\nconcern of the bank whether anybody else has any interest or stake in\n                                    18\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe deposit and even assuming it to be so, it is for the latter to stake\n\nclaim to it after the defendant No.1 has discharged its liability to the\n\nnominee and the nominee has received the amount from it. The\n\ndefendant is holding the sum of Rs.15,00,000/- and earning huge\n\nreturns on it without paying anything even by way of interest to the\n\nplaintiff which works out to nearly 500/- per day. The defendant is\n\nmaking unsustainable and untenable distinction between 'certificate of\n\ndeposit ' and 'fixed deposit' only to deprive her of the amount to which\n\nshe is lawfully entitle and to hold the same as long as possible and earn\n\nout of its investment. In view of admission therein of receipt of the\n\noriginal certificates by the defendant and letter written to the plaintiff\n\non 20/12/2000 as extracted and referred to in para No.5 of the plaint the\n\ndefendant is bound to make payment to her.\n\n\n12)     The plaintiff further submit that the alleged rule of the bank\n\nagainst nomination which according to the defendant itself violated is\n\nnot part of any statue or law and hence the plea of estoppel does not\n\noperate against it, which is legally unsustainable. The alleged rule of\n\nthe bank is neither statue nor law. No such alleged rule was bought to\n                                     19\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe notice of the depositor at the time of making deposit. The WILL is\n\ngenuine, but she is basing her claim exclusively as registered nominee\n\nand reference to the WIIL in the plaint is only collateral and of little\n\nconsequence and the defendant cannot compel the plaintiff to obtain\n\nletters of administration/probate when her relief against the defendant\n\nis not based on the WILL, which even otherwise, requires no probate as\n\nplaintiff is Hindu. It is false that she was called upon to obtain letter of\n\nadministration/ probate and that therefore no reply was sent to her legal\n\nnotice, because the defendant had no defence to her claim and wanted\n\nto avoid putting anything in writing and retain the amount payable to\n\nher as long as possible. The plaintiff prays to reject the written\n\nstatement filed by defendants and decree the suit filed by her.\n\n\n13)      The brief facts of plaint averments in OS.No.2731/2002 is as\n\nunder:\n\n\n          The plaintiff submits that he and the defendants No.1 to 5 are\n\nlegal heirs of late Sampath Singh Bohra, who died on 18/11/2000 at\n\nBangalore and they are only legal heirs and succeeded to the estate of\n                                    20\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe late Sampath Singh Bohra in respect of the schedule mentioned\n\nproperties. He is the eldest son, defendant No.1 is wife and defendants\n\nNo.2 to 5 are children of late Sampath Singh Bohra. The defendant\n\nNo.6 is the Bank in which the his father has deposited Rs.15,00,000/-\n\nunder Negotiable Certificate of deposit. He is seeking for interim relief\n\nagainst the Bank not to pay the amount to the defendants alone. That\n\nlate Sampath Singh Bohra hailed from Bilara of Jodhpur District in the\n\nState of Rajasthan and after coming to Bangalore, he married defendant\n\nNo.1 at Thirupathi in the year 1960. That late Sampath Singh Bohra\n\ninherited only an ancestral house situated at Bilara in Jodhapur District\n\nin the state of Rajasthan and except that property there is no other\n\nproperty belonged to Sampath Singh. The said house is under lock and\n\nthere is no income from the said property. That after coming to\n\nBangalore his father started an Auto Finance Business and out of said\n\nbusiness, his father earned lot of immovable and movable properties.\n\n\n14)      The plaintiff submits he is carrying on the business of Auto\n\nFinance and defendants No.2 and 3 are also carrying on own business\n\nof Auto Finance under Bohra Finance Pvt., Ltd., and earning their\n                                     21\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nlivelihood. Even defendant No.1 is carrying on Auto Finance Business\n\nunder the name and style of Surekhadevi Financier Automotive and has\n\ngot earnings of her own. The defendants No.4 and 5 are daughters of\n\nlate Sampath Singh Bohra and they are married and living with their\n\nrespective husbands. The marriage of daughters was performed by his\n\nfather by taking his help. Earlier he and defendants No.1 to 5 were\n\nresiding with late Sampath Singh Bohra at No.104, Railway Parallel\n\nRoad, Kumara Park West, Bangalore, which was a rented house. That\n\nhe married in the year 1989 and thereafter his wife and defendant No.1\n\nhad no good relationship, hence defendant No.1 started insisting his\n\nfather send him out of the house. Hence in the year 1992 he shifted to\n\nrented premises at Malleshwaram. In the year 1992 his father\n\npurchased the property bearing Site No.155 measuring 40 x 60 at 8 th\n\nMain Road, Vasantha Nagar West Extension Bangalore 560052 with\n\nconstructed building thereon. The building consists of ground floor and\n\nfirst floor with two car garage on the right and left side of the building.\n\nThe ground floor was purchased by his father in the name of defendant\n\nNo.1 for valuable consideration of Rs.6,00,000/- on 22/08/1992.\n                                   22\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nHowever the entire consideration was paid by the father alone i.e.\n\nSchedule 1-A and another property bearing No.1, 7 th cross, 8th Main\n\nRoad, Malleshwaram, Bangalore-3 measuring 3000 Sq. Ft., i.e.\n\nSchedule 1-B purchased by his father in the name of defendant No.1.\n\nThese two properties were given to her by his father for just getting\n\nincome for her needs only and to live with dignity and pride without\n\nseeking help from others. But she is not the absolute owner of these\n\nproperties. The consideration for both the properties was paid by his\n\nfather. She cannot deal with these properties in any manner whatsoever.\n\nThe first floor portion of the property purchased on 11/11/1992 as\n\ndescribed in the Schedule Item No.I.\n\n\n15)   The plaintiff further submits that in fact the defendant No.1 was\n\nnot in good terms even with her husband late Sampath Singh Bohra.\n\nThat his father purchased the ground floor of the Suit Schedule Item\n\nNo.1 property in the name of defendant No.1 and also with view to\n\nprovide income for her and also provide a capital for her to start her\n\nown Auto Finance Business and thus the defendant No.1 has started an\n\nAuto Finance Business in the name and style \"Surekhadevi Financier\n                                    23\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nAutomotive\". The plaintiff further submits that defendants No.1 to 3\n\nare totally non co-operative and always quarreling with the father of the\n\nplaintiff for money. To maintain the dignity of the family, the father of\n\nthe plaintiff made provision for income to the defendants No.1 to 3 by\n\nproviding them necessary capital to start their own business. The tenant\n\nwho had occupied the ground floor of the suit schedule Item No.1\n\nproperty vacated the same in the year 1993. Till then the father of the\n\nplaintiff was carrying on the business since the first floor of house i.e.\n\ndoor No.37/1 since there was no separate premises available, even the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 had also carried their respective business in the\n\nsuit schedule item No.1 property. The ground floor portion below the\n\nSuit Schedule Item No.1 was occupied by the tenant and suit schedule\n\nitem No.1 property was in his possession and his father and defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 were carrying on business in the Item No.1. After the ground\n\nfloor was vacated late Sampath Singh Bohra shifted part of the business\n\nto the ground floor. The defendants No.1 to 3 were always in inimical\n\ntowards him and also harassing his father for money. The defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 were not tolerating even he has talk with his father. The\n                                   24\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendant No.4 got married in the year 1995 and thereafter difference\n\nbetween Sampath Singh Bohra on one hand and defendants No.1 to 3\n\non the other increased leading to a total breakdown of peace and\n\ntranquility in the family. Late Sampath Singh Bohra was suffering from\n\ndiabetes and Hypertension and due to the ill treatment from defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 he was undergoing lot of suffering and pain. In fact he was\n\nundergoing tension and anxiety and suffered fall sustaining injury.\n\nTherefore Late Sampath Singh Bohra was compelled to leave the first\n\nfloor and started stay in the ground floor taking food from outside.\n\nSince there was nobody to look after late Sampath Singh Bohra and\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 were not allowing him to come and look after his\n\nfather. That his father was suffering from mental agony. Due to affinity\n\ntowards the property his father was reluctant to come and stay with him\n\nin the rented property at Malleshwaram. Therefore on the advice of the\n\nwell wishers of the family, a sort of settlement was arrived at between\n\nthe defendants No.1 to 3 and late Sampath Singh Bohra on 22/02/1996.\n\nOn the basis of the said settlement the defendants No.1 to 3 shifted\n\nfrom first floor to the ground floor. The defendant No.1 and late\n                                     25\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nSampath Singh Bohra decided not to live jointly as husband and wife\n\nand they have mutually agreed to live separately or the rest of their life.\n\nFurther under said settlement defendant No.1 was paid Rs.5,00,000/-\n\nand defendants No.2 and 3 were paid Rs.10,00,000/- each by his father.\n\nThus in 1996 the defendants No.1 to 3 were residing in the ground\n\nfloor and his father was alone staying in the first floor. Though his\n\nfather was alone in the first floor there was no peace of mind to his\n\nfather due to the ill treatment meted out by the defendants No.1 to 3 in\n\n1994 the land lord of the premises in which he was residing at\n\nMalleshwaram filed an eviction petition against him in HRC\n\nNo.2329/1994 which came to be allowed on 25/05/1998. He preferred\n\nappeal in Revision petition in HRRP No.178/1998. The said revision\n\npetition came to be dismissed on 17/08/1998 granting time to him till\n\nFebruary 2000 to vacate and hand over the possession to the landlord.\n\nSince he had no other property to stay, his father asked him to come\n\nand stay with him in the first floor i.e. Suit Schedule Item-I property.\n\nThen he shifted his residence to the Suit Schedule Item-I in the year\n\n2000. Ever since then he is staying in the Suit Schedule Item No.1\n                                     26\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nproperty and using the entire premises along with his father. In the year\n\n1999 the health of late Sampath Singh Bohra deteriorated fully and\n\nhence as per the advise of doctor he was constrained to shift to the\n\nground floor and till his death he was staying in the ground floor\n\nportion. The defendants No.2 and 3 after taking the money from the\n\nfather purchased the property bearing No.173 in which they started\n\nstaying separately i.e. in Suit Schedule 3-A property.\n\n\n\n16)   The plaintiff further submits that Suit Schedule 3A property has\n\nbeen purchased by late Sampath Singh Bohra in the name defendant\n\nNo.2 nominally and the entire consideration for the same has been paid\n\nby his father. He is entitle to 1/6th share in this property. That he learnt\n\nfrom reliable sources that site bearing No.2382, HAL 3 rd stage,\n\nBangalore as detailed in Suit Schedule 3-B was purchased by the\n\ndefendants No.1 and 2 jointly. The plaintiff further submits that entire\n\nconsideration for the same was paid by his father and he is entitle to\n\n1/6th share in this property. The plaintiff further submits that his father\n\nexpired on 18/11/2000 leaving behind the property shown in the\n\nschedule. These schedule properties are self acquired properties of his\n                                      27\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nfater late Sampath Singh Bohra. That his father died intestate and hence\n\nhe and defendants No.1 to 5 have got equal share in respect of all the\n\nschedule properties. The defendants No.1 to 3 with an intention to\n\ndeprive his legitimate share out of the self acquired properties of late\n\nSampath Singh Bohra stared claiming that his father executed WILL\n\nand bequeathed all his properties in favour of the defendants No.1 to 3\n\nand further insisting him to vacate the property.\n\n\n17)       The plaintiff further submits that in fact his father has made\n\ndeposit in Global Trust Bank Limited under two Negotiable Certificate\n\nof Deposit bearing Nos.15024289 and 150254293 for an amount of\n\nRs.7,00,000/-and     Rs.8,00,000/-    respectively   [Suit    Schedule-4\n\nproperty]. These deposits were matured on 29/11/2000 and 11/12/2000.\n\nThe defendant No.1 made an attempt to withdraw this amount without\n\nhis knowledge. It appears the Global Trust Bank Limited has requested\n\nthe defendant No.1 to produce the succession certificate for receiving\n\nthe amount from the Bank. Therefore there was dispute between\n\ndefendant No.1 and the Global Trust Bank Limited and defendant No.1\n\nfiled suit in O.S.No.15743/2001 seeking for mandatory injunction\n                                    28\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nagainst the Global Trust Bank directing the Bank to pay the amount in\n\nher favour. When the bank refused defendant made reference to WILL\n\nalleged to be executed by late Sampath Singh Bohra but has not\n\nproduced the same in the suit. This fact came to his knowledge and he\n\nhas filed application in OS.No.15743/2001 U/o I Rule 10(2)\nCPC\nand\n\nsaid application was allowed and he was impleaded as defendant No.2.\n\n\n18)    The plaintiff further submits that the alleged WILL is concocted\n\nand created and his father never executed any WILL and in fact the\n\nrelationship his father and defendants No.1 to 3 was also not cordial.\n\nThe defendants No.1 to 3 must have created the alleged WILL only to\n\ndeprive his legitimate share in respect of the suit schedule property. In\n\nfact there was no love and affection between his father and the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 because of constant harassment given by\n\ndefendants No.2 to 3 to his father. The Plaintiff further submits that his\n\nfather filed criminal case against the defendants No.1 to 3 and even the\n\nMemorandum of understanding dated 22/02/1996 clearly shows that\n\nthere is no cordiality love and affection between his father and\n\ndefendants No.2 to 3. The defendants No.1 to 3 are concocting story of\n                                    29\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nWILL only to deprive his legitimate share in the properties left behind\n\nby his late father. In view of false claim made by defendants No.1 to 3\n\nhe has constrained to seek partition and separate possession of 1/5th\n\nshare in respect of the suit schedule property which are self acquired\n\nproperties of his father. The plaintiff submits that from the so called\n\ncertified copy of the WILL it is seen that late Sampath Singh Bohra had\n\nstated that he was tenant of shop premises bearing No.100, Subedar\n\nChatram Road, Bangalore and defendant No.2 has produced receipt at\n\nExD41 admitting he has paid Rs.120/- as rent for the said premises for\n\nNovember and December 2000. But now he understand that defendant\n\nNo.2 has handed over the premises to the owner after receiving\n\nRs.10,00,000/- as compensation from the owner. That he is entitle for\n\n1/6th share being Rs.1,66,666/- together with interest at the rate of 18%\n\np.a. which is detailed in Schedule-7 and defendant No.2 is utilizing this\n\namount in his finance business.\n\n19)    The plaintiff submits that cause of action for the suit arose from\n\n18/11/2000 when his father expired and subsequently when defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 refused to give share and started insisting him to vacate the\n                                    30\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\npremises by concocting the story of WILL in OS.No.15743/2001. Since\n\nhe is claiming his legitimate share in respect of the properties of his\n\nfather, defendants are now trying to take law into their own hands and\n\ntrying to disturb his possession in respect of Suit Schedule Item No.I\n\nand hence he is constrained to seek injunction against defendants. The\n\nplaintiff further submits that his father has got several bank accounts\n\nand those accounts are in custody of the defendant No.1. The defendant\n\nNo.1 is trying to withdraw the amount in those accounts and in fact has\n\nalready utilized part of the amount lying in those accounts. That his\n\nfather advanced money to several borrowers and defendants have\n\nrealized the said amounts. The plaintiff prays to decree for partition and\n\nseparate possession against defendants for 1/5th share in all the suit\n\nschedule properties and separate possession by metes and bounds in\n\nrespect of the suit schedule properties No.1 to 3 and direct the\n\ndefendant No.1 to furnish the detailed accounts in respect of the money\n\nleft behind by his father and to pay the mesne profits and also 1/5th\n\nshare in all the movables left behind by the late Sampath Singh Bohra\n\nand 1/4th share in HUF capital.\n                                  31\n                                                   O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                   C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n                          SCHEDULE-I\n     All that first floor proton of the property bearing\n\n     corporation No.37/1 measuring 12.81 Squared with the\n\n     garage on the ground floor (facing north) built on site\n\n     No.155 measuring East to West 40 feet and North to South\n\n     60 feet, 8th Main Road, Vasanthanagar West Extension,\n\n     Bangalore 560 052 with an undivided interest in the site\n\n     bearing No.155 bounded on East by site bearing No.154,\n\n     West by 30 feet cross road, North by 40 feet Road and\n\n     South by site No.173.\n\n                         SCHEDULE I-A\n     All that first floor proton of the property bearing\n\n     corporation No.37, 1st cross, 8th Main Road, Vasanthanagar\n\n     West, Bangalore 52 measuring 12.81 squares with the\n\n     garage facing west site measuring 60\" x 40\" with an\n\n     undivided 50% in the site bearing No.155 bounded on the\n\n     East: property No.154, West 30 feet cross road, North 40\n\n     feet road and South property No.173.\n\n                         SCHEDULE I-B\n                                  32\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n     All that piece and parcel off ground and first floor old\n\n     house property bearing No.1, 7th Cross, 8th Main road,\n\n     Malleshwaram, Bangalore 3 measuring about 3000 sq. ft\n\n     bounded on the East 8th Main Road, West 11th Main road,\n\n     Malleshwaram Rly. station road, North Property No.2 in\n\n     8th Main Road, South 7th cross, Malleshwaram.\n\n                           SCHEDULE-2\n     All that piece and parcel of immovable property being a\n\n     vacant site bearing No.314C situated in the private layout\n\n     at Kenchanahalli and Haligevaderahalli, Kengeri Hobli,\n\n     Bangalore south taluk formed by the ideal Homes co\n\n     operative society Ltd., and approved by the Bangalore\n\n     Development Authority, together with all rights, privileges\n\n     and appurtenances thereto and site measuring East to west\n\n     48 ft = 49 ft/2, north to south 65 Ft + 69 Ft/2, total area\n\n     3249.5 Sq.

The defendant No.1 to 3 further submits that\n\ndefendant No.6 is not necessary or proper party to the suit, as there is\n\nalready suit in O.S.No.15743/2001 against the defendant No.5 by the\n\ndefendant No.1, who had been nominated to receive the sum of\n\nRs.15,00,000/- in the event of the death of her husband before maturity\n\nbesides being entitle to the said sum as a residual legatee under the said\n\nWILL. The plaintiff got himself impleaded as the defendant No.2 in the\n\nsaid suit and thus he was aware of the same pending in CCH-22 at\n\nMayo Hall, when he filed the present suit. Nevertheless he has made\n\nthe false averments in plaint para-8 to the following effect: \"There is no\n\npendency of any legal proceedings and litigation either past or present\n\nconcerning any part of subject matter of this plaint in any court within\n\nthe knowledge of the plaintiff\". That OS.No.15743/2001 was filed by\n\nthe defendant No.1 herein against the defendant No.6 herein on\n\n18/06/2001 and the plaintiff herein filed his impleading application in\n\nthe said suit on 25/09/2001 and the same was allowed on 02/01/2002\n                                    37\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nand he was impleaded as defendant No.2 in OS.No.15743/2001 on\n\n30/01/2002.\n\n\n21)   The defendant No.1 to 3 further submits that the present suit has\n\nbeen filed nearly three months later on 18/04/2002. Thus he himself\n\nhaving been party to the earlier suit involving plaint schedule-4\n\nproperty in this suit that is Rs.15,00,000/-, he has deliberately made\n\nfalse statement vide para No.8 of the plaint as detailed above, further in\n\nO.S No.15743/2001 he has acted in collusion with the defendant No.6\n\nherein (Global Trust Bank) falsely describing the term deposit of\n\nRs.15,00,000/- in respect of which the first defendant was registered as\n\nthe nominee by the bank itself, as a negotiable instrument. The plaintiff\n\ncannot in this suit seek any interim relief to direct the defendant No.6\n\nherein not to pay Rs.15,00,000/- to the defendant No.1. The defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 further submits that the remedy if any in this behalf lies\n\nelsewhere that is in OS.No.15743/2001 to which himself voluntarily\n\ngot impleaded as defendant No.2 and has filed his written statement\n\ntherein in manner supporting the dilatory tactics of the bank, which is\n\nwithholding the large sum of Rs.15,00,000/- for more than year now\n                                    38\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nand earning interest thereon. Hence the court strikes be off defendant\n\nNo.6 U/o 1 Rule 10 (2)\nof CPC\n. As regards para No.3 of the plaint.\n\nThe defendants No.1 to 3 further submits it is true that except the house\n\nat Rajasthan, all the properties both movable and immovable as\n\ndetailed in the plaint schedule were the self-acquisitions of late\n\nSampath Singh. However the reference in the said para to the ground\n\nfloor No.37, which is in exclusive possession of the defendant No.1, as\n\nthe absolute owner and khatedar as having been purchased by Sampath\n\nSingh in the name of defendant No.1 is absolutely false. The\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 further submits that purchase of the ground floor\n\nwas by defendant No.1 exclusively with her own funds and it is her\n\nexclusively owned property. The first floor No.37/1 was of course\n\npurchased by Sampath Singh for himself with his own funds and as\n\nsuch the same was his self- acquired property. It is false that Sampath\n\nSingh and defendant No.1 were not on good terms. If that were to be\n\nso, how is it that he is alleged to have purchased the ground floor out of\n\nhis money in her name for her benefit and provided capital to her to\n\nstart automobile finance business. On 26/03/1992 at about 5 a.m.\n                                    39\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nplaintiff at the instigation of his wife voluntarily and abruptly left the\n\nKumarpark house where the joint family was then residing and started\n\nresiding in rented house in Malleshwaram, where he continued to\n\nreside till February 2000. He then requested Sampath Singh for\n\ntemporary accommodation in the first floor for just three months on the\n\nground that there was eviction order against him in respect of the\n\nMalleswaram house and that the house purchased by him at R.T. Nagar\n\nrequired repairs and renovation. He was provided Rs.10,00,000/- by\n\nSampath Singh in November 1995 and with some addition of\n\nRs.3,00,000/- from his HUF to his wife's account he purchased it in the\n\nname of his wife, that is he purchased the R.T. Nagar house for more\n\nthan Rs.10,00,000/- and on the plea that it required repairs and\n\nrenovation sought and got leave and license from Sampath Singh for a\n\nthree-month stay in the first floor No.37/1 but continued to stay therein\n\neven after the death of Sampath Singh illegally. The defendants No.1 to\n\n3 further submits that leave and license was restricted to the first floor\n\n(Less two rooms) and did not cover the garage attached to it, which\n\nwas in possession of late Sampath Singh and continues to be in\n                                    40\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\npossession after his death by defendant No.1. The garage has also an\n\nentrance from the ground floor No.37 since more than 3 years. The\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 further submits that under the registered WILL\n\ndated 01/07/2000 of Sampath Singh the first floor was bequeathed to\n\nthe first defendant by way of life interest followed by the same going to\n\ndefendant No.3 on her demise and he acquiring absolute ownership\n\ntherein. Thus on the death of Sampath Singh on 18/11/2000 the entire\n\nfirst floor No.37/1 vested with defendant No.1 as one of the\n\nbeneficiaries under his registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 and\n\nplaintiff's occupation after the death of Sampath Singh, the leave and\n\nlicense elapsed and got automatically revoked, and the plaintiff is\n\ncontinuing to occupy the first floor (schedule I of plaint) under revoked\n\nlicense in property of which the defendant No.1 has become owner\n\nunder the WILL of her late husband. Hence defendant No.1 is entitle to\n\nseek occupation of the first floor (plaint schedule-I item) through\n\ndirection by means of decree of mandatory injunction calling upon the\n\nplaintiff to cease using and occupying plaint schedule item-I and permit\n\nits use and occupation by the first defendant. Besides defendant is\n                                    41\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nentitle to damages from the plaintiff for unlawful use and occupation\n\nfrom 18/11/2000, on which date she acquired interest in the first floor\n\nthrough her husband's registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 up to date i.e.\n\nfor period of 19 months at the rate of Rs.12,000/- per month as the first\n\nmonth is nearly 1300 square feet in extent and even if let out at a\n\nmodest rate of about Rs.9/- per square feet. The minimum monthly rent\n\nfrom the said first floor will be nearly Rs.12,000/- per month. Hence\n\ndefendant No.1 is entitle to sum of Rs.2,28,000/- by way of damages\n\nfor use and occupation or mesne profits from 18/11/2000 to date\n\nbesides an enquiry into future mesne profits. Thus the defendant No.1\n\nbesides seeking dismissal of the suit on the ground that all the plaint\n\nschedule self-acquired properties of the late Sampath Singh were\n\nbequeathed to his heirs including to plaintiff by registered WILL dated\n\n01/07/2000 and that nothing remained to be partitioned after his death\n\nand as on the date of filing of this suit, is at this stage itself making\n\ncounter claim U/O 8 rule 6A\nCPC\nfor relief of Mandatory Injunction in\n\nrespect of plaint item No.1 (first floor No.37/1) directing plaintiff to\n\ncease using and occupying the same and to permit its use and\n                                     42\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\noccupation by the first defendant, damages for use and occupation\n\nagainst the plaintiff in respect of the plaint item No.1 (1 st floor) at the\n\nrate of Rs.12,000/- per month amounting to Rs.2,28,000/- for the period\n\n18/11/2000 to 17/06/2001 for enquiry relating to future mesne profits.\n\n\n22)      The defendants No.1 to 3 further submits in respect of the\n\nallegations of non-cooperation and quarrels are traverse of truth nor is\n\nit true that they were silenced by Sampath Singh through payments\n\nallegedly made to them by him for starting their own business. The\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 further submits that they have been doing\n\nbusiness on their own and with their skill and enterprise commenced\n\nand developed their individual business. It is false to allege that after\n\nthe marriage of the defendant No.4 alleged difference and quarrels\n\nbetween these defendants and Sampath Singh escalated and that he was\n\nill-treated by these defendants leading to increase in his hypertension\n\nand diabetes. He continued to reside in the 1 st floor and was doing\n\nbusiness in the ground floor and it is utterly false that he was not being\n\nprovided home food and that he was getting food from outside. The\n\nrepeated allegations of cruelty by these defendants and resultant mental\n                                    43\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nagony to Sampath Singh have their origin in the plaintiff's mind to\n\ncreate prejudice against these defendants. On the other hand he was not\n\nat all willing to stay at any time with the plaintiff in the plaintiff's\n\nrented house at Malleshwaram, as he did not appreciate plaintiff's\n\nattitude and aggressive behaviour towards the other members of his\n\nfamily. Plaintiff was at loggerhead with Sampath Singh and there was\n\nbad blood between them. However to satisfy the late Sampath Singh\n\nand to prevent any deterioration in his health, as per his wish these\n\ndefendants and defendants No.4 and 5 signed what he told them was\n\nMemorandum of Understanding, so as to abide by his wish they just\n\nsigned being unaware of its contents and not at all getting any benefit\n\nor advantage there from. This was done under pressure from certain\n\nrelatives, who insisted on doing so on the ground that it would be in the\n\ninterest of the family and the well-being of Sampath Singh. There was\n\nno shifting by these defendants to the ground floor in pursuance of the\n\nalleged Memorandum of Understanding. As in case of the\n\nMemorandum, to please Sampath Singh and to avoid any bitterness\n\nthese defendants signed receipts referring therein to some payments,\n                                    44\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nwhich in fact these defendants did not receive. All this happened under\n\nthe honest belief entertained by these defendants that if, they did not\n\nsign, no matter they got no benefit from their doing so, there would be\n\ndisharmony and even disaster if something happened to Sampath\n\nSingh, consequent to his indifferent health. As regards stay of plaintiff\n\nin the first floor from February 2000, this was by way of temporary\n\nlicensed accommodation on the twin grounds of eviction order in\n\nrespect of the Malleswaram property and non-completion of plaintiff's\n\nown bungalow at R.T. Nagar. His stay in the 1st floor was not in his\n\nown right and Sampath Singh was not residing with him in the 1 st floor.\n\nIn fact plaintiff was not accommodated in the entire first floor, but in\n\nthe 1st floor less two rooms and garage. These two rooms contained\n\nSampath Singh's documents and personal articles and the plaintiff\n\nunlocked these rooms and removed the articles and documents. After\n\nSampath Singh's death he has occupied the other two rooms also, but\n\nthe garage continues to b..e in occupation of the first defendant. In fact\n\nas stated by the plaintiff himself in para-4 till his death Sampath Singh\n\nwas residing in the ground floor. It is false that property No.173 was\n                                    45\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\npurchased by defendants No.2 and 3 with the money allegedly got from\n\nSampath Singh. In fact it was purchased only by defendant No.2 with\n\nhis own earnings and not through any alleged payment to him by\n\nSampath Singh. Thus premises No.173 is the self-acquisition of the 2 nd\n\ndefendant and it was not acquired in the mode and manner as alleged\n\nby the plaintiff.\n\n\n23)   The defendant No.1 to 3 further submits that Sampath Singh died\n\ntestate bequeathing all his self acquired properties through will\n\nvoluntarily executed and registered by him on 01/07/2002, as he was\n\nkeeping indifferent health and did not want any scramble after his death\n\nin view of the aggressive conduct and avaracious nature of the plaintiff.\n\nNot-withstanding having paid the plaintiff Rs.10,00,000/- earlier to\n\nenable him to purchase a bungalow at RT Nagar, under the WILL he\n\nbequeathed in his favour shop premises No.91, SC Road,\n\nSeshadripuram in occupation of tenant from whom in pursuance of the\n\nWILL the plaintiff is collecting rents as the owner and landlord thereof.\n\nHe is estopped from now denying the execution of the WILL under\n\nwhich besides the aforesaid shop premises, he was also bequeathed a\n                                   46\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\npistol one curio and a table, the last two being in his possession. The\n\npistol found in dismantled condition in the bathroom dhaba of the\n\nground floor along with the expired license was deposited by the first\n\ndefendant in the High Ground Police Station\nu/s 21\nof the Arms Act on\n\n27/05/2002 he was also bequeathed 1/4 th share in item at schedule-5 of\n\nplaint. The defendants No.1 to 3 further submits that as regards the\n\nRs.15,00,000/- deposit by Sampath Singh with defendant No.6 and\n\nnomination in favour of the first defendant, she became entitled to the\n\nsame as the registered nominee on the maturity dates 29/11/2000 and\n\n11/12/2000 as well as under the registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 as\n\nthe residual legatee but in collusion with the defendant No.6 the\n\ndeposits are being falsely described as Negotiable Instruments to\n\ndeprive her of the benefit of the same. The defendants No.1 to 3 further\n\nsubmits that at any rate, as already stated above, the said deposits are\n\nthe subject matter of the earlier suits O.S 15743/2001 by defendant\n\nNo.1 in CCH-22 at Mayo Hall. It is false that the plaintiff learnt of\n\nSampath Singh's WILL for first time after demand of the deposited\n\namount by defendant No.1 from defendant No.6 and refusal to pay by\n                                    47\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendant No.6. The allegations of the plaintiff that the registered\n\nWILL dated 01/07/2000 of Sampath Singh is concoction is nothing\n\nshort of gross insult to the departed soul, who through testamentary\n\ndistribution of his self acquired properties equitably, distributed the\n\nsame to all his heirs in a spirit of justice and fair-play. As regard some\n\nearlier minor domestic differences, long prior to the execution of the\n\nWILL between Sampath Singh and defendants No.1 to 3, these were\n\nsettled including criminal complaint by Sampath Singh against these\n\ndefendants at the instigation of the plaintiff, but which ended in \"B\"\n\nfinal report with nothing further. Thus in face of the genuine and\n\nvoluntary disposition of all his immovable and movable properties by\n\nlate Sampath Singh and his WILL having come into force on\n\n18/11/2000, the date of his death, the suit seeking partition is not\n\nmaintainable and plaintiff is liable to be non-suited. The defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 further submits that there is no cause of action at all for the\n\nsuit as stated therein. What arose on 18/11/2000 was the vesting of\n\nvarious properties, immovable and movable will all the heirs of\n\nSampath Singh including the plaintiff as detailed in his WILL. Hence\n                                     48\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe question of plaintiff and these defendants refusing to give his\n\nalleged share to him does not at all arise.\n\n\n24)     The defendants No.1 to 3 further submits that the plaintiff is not\n\nentitle to any injunction against these defendants in respect of the 1 st\n\nfloor, as in this suit they have themselves conceded that he is in\n\nunlawful possession of the same, without the garage, under an expired\n\nlicense and have sought decrees of mandatory injunction and damages\n\nby way of past mesne profits. The deceased was maintaining only two\n\naccounts in the Syndicate Bank, Vasantha Nagar Branch, S.B.Account\n\nNo.17047 in his personal capacity and another current account No.744\n\nin his capacity as the Kartha of the Hindu Undivided Family. The HUF\n\namount of Rs.4,30,491=35Ps has been withdrawn by the defendant\n\nNo.1 and Rs.1,00,000/- got from debtor Chandrakant on HUF account\n\nas the nominee and she is ready to pay plaintiff's 1/4 th share from this\n\ntotal capital of HUF amounting to Rs.5,46,316=12ps which she has\n\nkept in fixed deposit having paid 1/4th share each therein to defendants\n\nNo.2 and 3 and retained her own 1/4 th share. This amount is item\n\nNo.5(d) of schedule 5 to the plaint. From the debtors of Sampath Singh,\n                                   49\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthese defendants could realize only Rs.80,000/- from Gopala Krishna,\n\nRs.1,32,000/- from Chandrakant and The defendants No.1 to 3 further\n\nsubmits that no amount is due from Guru Sastri Mutt. As regards\n\nT.N.Suresh only sum of Rs.4,50,000/- is due from him and it is as good\n\nas lost and non-recoverable, as the said T.N.Suresh is absconding and\n\nhis whereabouts are not known. There is also complaint of cheating by\n\nlate Sampath Singh against Suresh in the Bharathinagar Police Station.\n\nThere is also CC.No.32611/2000 pending against Anantapadmanath\n\nrelating to bouncing of cheque of Rs.10,00,000/- issued to Sampath\n\nSingh for loan advanced to him and O.S No.6777/97 against\n\nPadmachand for recovery of Rs.1,72,000/-. The suit is not properly\n\nvalued and court fee paid is insufficient. As regards plaint para-8, as\n\nalready stated above suit O.S No.15743/2001 in respect of plaint\n\nschedule item No.4 was already pending in CCH-22 against defendant\n\nNo.6 and the statement in para 8 is false to the knowledge of the\n\nplaintiff and case of gross misrepresentation to the court. In fact\n\nplaintiff himself got impleaded in the said suit through his IA U/O 1\n\nrule 10 filed on 25/09/2001, long prior to filing of this suit and the\n                                    50\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nsame was allowed on 02/01/2002. This suit has been filed on\n\n18/04/2002. As regards schedules to the plaint, item in schedule-1\n\nthrough the WILL of Sampath Singh has vested with defendant No.1\n\nby way of life interest followed by defendant No.3 acquiring absolute\n\nownership. Item detailed in schedule-2 has gone jointly to defendants\n\nNo.4 and 5, item in schedule-3 has been bequeathed to plaintiff\n\nabsolutely and he has been recovering rents from the tenant in\n\noccupation of it since the date of death of Sampath Singh. It is valuable\n\ncommercial property and its present market value is not less than\n\nRs.10,00,000/-. As regards Schedule-5 item 1 and 2 therein, i.e. 4\n\nbangles the present market value of which is nearly 4-5 lakhs and Fiat\n\nUno Car have been bequeathed to defendant No.1 and she is the\n\nabsolute owner thereof. The RC relating to the UNO has also been\n\ntransferred in her name. As regards item No.3 of schedule-5 as on the\n\ndate of death of Sampath Singh the amount in his SB personal Account\n\nNo.17047 was Rs.1,20,932=78ps. SB Account No.17050 in Syndicate\n\nBank is not at all connected with the deceased. It is the personal\n\naccount of the defendant No.1. The plaintiff has no right or claim to\n                                     51\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nany share in SB A/c No.17050 of defendant No.1, but, as already stated\n\nearlier he is entitle only to 1/4th share in HUF current account No.744\n\nand as per the WILL, the amount in SB Account No.17047 held by the\n\ndeceased as per the WILL has gone to the defendant No.1, to which\n\nalso she had been earlier nominated. Cash on hand of Rs.68,057=70ps\n\nalso has vested in defendant No.1 as per the WILL. As per the WILL\n\nthe plaintiff also gets by bequeath to the extent of 1/3 rd share in item\n\ndetailed in schedule-6. As regards schedule-4 defendant No.1 is the\n\nregistered nominee in respect of the sum of Rs.15,00,000/- is also\n\nentitle to this sum, to the exclusion of plaintiff and defendants No.2 to\n\n5 as she is entitle under the WILL of Sampath Singh to residual\n\nproperty left behind by him, or that in other words, she is the residual\n\nlegatee, and thus also succeeds as such to the matured deposit amount\n\nof Rs.15,00,000/- unlawfully being with held by the defendant No.6 on\n\nthe instigation of the plaintiff. Thus plaintiff is bound by the registered\n\nWILL of Sampath Singh and he is not entitle to partition as sought for\n\nin his suit. The defendants No.2 and 3 prays to dismiss the suit of\n\nplaintiff with costs and decree their counter claim for mandatory\n                                     52\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ninjunction against the plaintiff directing the plaintiff to cease using and\n\noccupying plaint schedule-1 first floor including two rooms (without\n\ngarage which is in occupation of defendant No.1) and permit its\n\noccupation by the defendant No.1, and prays to decree the counter\n\nclaim against plaintiff directing to pay sum of Rs.2,28,000/- by way of\n\ndamages/mesne profits from 19/11/2000 to date and direct enquiry for\n\nfuture mesne profits. The defendants No.2 & 3 prays to award costs of\n\nthe suit.\n\n\n25)     The plaintiff in O.S.No.2731/2002 has filed rejoinder to the\n\ncounter claims of defendants and submits the written statement is not in\n\naccordance with the provisions\nof CPC\nand does not satisfy the\n\ningredients of Rule 6A of\nOrder 8 CPC\n, hence defendants shall make\n\ntheir claim by filing only an independent suit. The plaintiff submits that\n\nit is false to state that he is staying in the suit schedule item No.1 as\n\nlicencee. The intention of the defendants is to dispossess him from the\n\nsuit schedule property using force. The plaintiff submits that it is false\n\nto state that his late Sampath Singh Bohra executed WILL dated\n                                    53\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n01/07/2000. The alleged WILL is created by defendants No.1 to 3 to\n\navoid equal share to him out of the properties left behind by his father.\n\n\n26)     The plaintiff submits that his father was suffering from serious\n\nill-health since 1996 and ultimately expired on 18/11/2000. The\n\ndefendants 1 to 3 have created WILL to avoid his legitimate share. It is\n\nfalse that defendant No.1 has been nominated to receive the sum of\n\nRs.15,00,000/- lying with defendant No.6. He already disclosed the\n\npendency of suit in OS.No.15743/2001 and there is no intention to\n\nsuppress anything before this court. The plaintiff submits that house\n\nsituated in R.T. Nagar, Bangalore belongs to his wife and does not\n\nbelong to the family of late Sampath Singh Bohra. It is false that\n\nSampath Singh Bohra provided Rs.10,00,000/- in November 1995 to\n\nhim. He shifted from Malleshwaram to the present suit schedule item\n\nNo.1 property as he had no other house to occupy and there was no\n\nother person to look after his father. The defendants No.1 to 3 were not\n\nlooking after his father and defendants were quarreling with his father\n\nfor money. He is all along occupying the entire premises of the suit\n\nschedule Item No.1 including garage. In fact now the defendants after\n                                      54\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nmaking open in the wall attached to the garage portion, with an\n\nintention to dispossess him from the suit schedule property, started\n\nmaking a claim that the garage is in their possession. It is false to state\n\nthat there is an entrance to the garage attached to door No.37/1 from\n\nthe ground floor of late the defendants No.1 to 3 have illegally broken\n\nthe wall in the ground floor and made attempt to enter into the garage\n\nportion. It is false that his father has bequeathed door No.37/1 to the\n\ndefendant No.1 and going to defendant No.3 on her death. The WILL\n\ndated 01/07/2000 is concocted and created, the story of leave and\n\nlicense is concoction made by defendants and there is no such leave\n\nand license granted by his father.\n\n\n27)     The plaintiff further submits he is staying in D.No.37/1 as son\n\nof late Sampath Singh Bohra and after the death of Sampath Singh\n\nBohra he along with defendants No.1 to 5 succeeded to estate of the\n\ndeceased. He is staying on his own right and no on the basis of any\n\nlimited right as alleged by defendants No.1 to 3. The plaintiff denied\n\nthat the defendant No.1 is entitle to seek occupation of the plaint\n\nschedule Item No.1. The defendants No.1 to 3 are not entitle for any\n                                     55\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nrelief in the present suit. The plaintiff denied that defendants are entitle\n\nfor damages from the him on the basis of alleged unlawful occupation\n\nof him from 18/11/2000. He denied that defendants No.1 to 3 have\n\nacquired absolute interest in suit schedule item No.1 through the\n\nalleged WILL dated 01/07/2000. The defendants are not entitled to\n\nRs.2,28,000/- by way of damages. The counter claim made by the\n\ndefendants cannot be adjudicated in the present suit as the nature of the\n\ncounter claim and the nature of the claim made in the suit are totally\n\ndifferent and cannot be tried in a single suit. Therefore defendants No.1\n\nto 3 may be directed to file separate suit for establishing their claim.\n\nThe defendants No.1 to 3 making false statement that without\n\nunderstanding the contents of the memorandum of understanding dated\n\n22/02/1996 they had put signature. The plaintiff denied that defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3    have not taken any benefit or advantage from he said\n\nmemorandum of understanding. The plaintiff does not own any\n\nbungalow at R.T. Nagar. The plaintiff denied that allegations of\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 that he is not in occupation of the entire suit\n\nschedule Item No.1 property. The plaintiff denied that property bearing\n                                    56\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nNo.173 is the self acquisition of the defendant No.2 and it was not\n\nacquired through the money given by the father of the plaintiff. The\n\nplaintiff denied that the allegations of defendants No.1 to 3 that he has\n\nreceived Rs.10,00,000/- from his father to enable him to purchase a\n\nbunglow at R.T. Nagar. The plaintiff admits that he is collecting the\n\nrents at Rs.150/- per month from the tenant in respect of the shop\n\npremises at No.91, Subedar Chatram Road, Sheshadriuram, Bangalore.\n\nThe plaintiff is ready to share the rent so received from the tenant in\n\naccordance with the share going to be demarcated by this court. The\n\nplaintiff denied the allegations of defendants No.1 to 3 that there is no\n\ncollusion between him and defendant No.6 in the matter of deposit\n\nlying with defendant No.6. The plaintiff has not caused insult to the\n\ndeparted soul by saying the WILL dated 01/07/2000 is created and\n\nconcocted. Even through \"B\" report has been filed in the complaint\n\nfiled by his father of against defendants No.1 to 3 the aversion created\n\nin the mind of the father of plaintiff was not removed. In fact his father\n\nhas agreed for filing the 'B' report in order to avoid the family matter\n\ngetting public. The very fact that the defendant No.1 for the first time\n                                     57\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ncontending that the plaintiff is entitled for a share in the amount lying\n\nin the HUF account without paying same disclosing the WILL clearing\n\nestablishes the fact that the WILL has been created only to avoid the\n\nshare of the plaintiff. Even in the suit OS.No.15743/2001 filed by the\n\ndefendant no.1 the alleged WILL was not produced.\n\n\n28)   The plaintiff submits that disclosures made by the defendants in\n\npara No.9 of the written statement is false. The plaintiff submits that\n\nthe defendants No.1 to 3 have recovered much ore amount than the one\n\nshown in para from the debtors and there exists more amount in the\n\naccount shown in said para. The defendants shall be directed to\n\nproduce the details before the court. It is false to state that the present\n\nmarket value of the Item No.(i) and (ii) of the schedule 5 is only about\n\nRs.15,00,000/-. The value of 4 bangles is about 15 lakhs. The alleged\n\ntransfer of car is illegal and in fact even the registering authority has\n\neffected the change of name subject to pending litigation. The nature of\n\ncounter claim is different from the nature of suit filed by the plaintiff\n\nand hence the counter claim cannot be entertained in the present suit.\n\nHence counter claim may be rejected as not maintainable. The plaintiff\n                                     58\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nprays to reject the counter claim of defendants No.1 to 3 and decree his\n\nsuit as prayed in the plaint.\n\n\n29)      The defendants No.1 and 2 in O.S.No.2731/2002 have filed\n\nadditional written statement dated 22/07/2009 wherein they have\n\ncontended that the contentions raised by the plaintiff by way of\n\namendment and introduction of additional facts are false, frivolous and\n\nvexatious to the knowledge of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has raised the\n\nsaid contentions after thought and there is absolutely no bonafides\n\nmuch less the same are tenable in law. Regarding the plaint the\n\ndefendants emphatically deny the contention of the plaintiff that\n\nproperties described in schedule-IA and schedule 1B of the plaint were\n\npurchased by the father of the plaintiff in the name of the 1 st defendant.\n\nIn fact the defendant No.1 became the exclusive and absolute owner in\n\npossession of the said properties on the strength of the registered sale\n\ndeeds and a rectification deed executed in her name from out of her\n\nown individual income earned by her in her automobile business and\n\ncertainly not from out of the funds alleged to have been provided by\n\nher husband i.e. the father of the plaintiff. In fact defendant No.1 has\n                                     59\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nbeen the Income Tax and Wealth Tax assessee in her individual\n\ncapacity for the last 36 years and the aforesaid registered deeds in\n\nrespect of the above said properties speak in volumes to the fact that\n\nboth the properties are indisputably the self acquisition of defendant\n\nNo.1. Under the circumstances there is absolutely no basis in the\n\ncontention of the plaintiff that the consideration for both the properties\n\nwere paid by his father and that defendant No.1 could not deal with the\n\nsaid properties on her own in any manner and the said contentions are\n\nfalse. To buttress the fact of self acquisition of the aforesaid properties,\n\ndefendant No.1 produced relevant documents pertaining to Income Tax,\n\nWealth Tax, Transport department and the documents of title referred to\n\nabove which are self explanatory. Apart from this fact, it is relevant to\n\nmention here that the defendant No.1 being the absolute owner in\n\npossession of the plaint schedule 1-A property has gifted the same in\n\nfavour of defendant No.3 by means of registered Gift Deed dated\n\n23/01/2007. The defendants emphatically deny the contention of the\n\nplaintiff that the property described in schedule 3-A of the plaint has\n\nbeen purchased by late Sampath Singh in the name of the defendant\n                                    60\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nNo.2 nominally and that the entire consideration for the same has been\n\npaid by the plaintiff's father. That the aforesaid property has been\n\nacquired by the defendant No.2 out of his own individual income\n\nearned by him in his individual business of automobile finance and\n\nbecame the absolute owner in possession of the same on the strength of\n\na registered Sale Deed dated 25/01/1997. The documents of title\n\npertaining to the said property are produced herewith along with\n\ndocuments pertaining to Income Tax and Hire Purchase Business. It is\n\nundisputed that the defendant No.2 has been the Income Tax assessee\n\nfor the last 20 years and he acquired the aforesaid property comprised\n\nin schedule 3A of the plaint, from out of his own income which fact is\n\nmore fully evidenced in the Bank Statement pertaining to the defendant\n\nNo.2's SB A/c maintained in Canara Bank, Kumara Park West\n\nBangalore-560020. The plaintiff has no iota of material to show that the\n\nsaid property has been purchased in the name of the defendant No.2 by\n\nhis father nominally and as such there is no basis in the contention that\n\nthe plaintiff is entitle for 1/6th share in the said property and the said\n\nclaim of the plaintiff is false and untenable to the knowledge of the\n                                      61\n                                                         O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                         C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nplaintiff. Further in the light of the contentions raised herein above,\n\nthere is no basis in the imaginary plea of the plaintiff that the joint\n\nacquisition of the defendants No.1 and 2 with respect to schedule 3B of\n\nthe plaint has been again financed by the father of the plaintiff and the\n\nsaid contention is false. When both the defendants No.1 and 2 are the\n\nIT assesses for the last several years having individual income of their\n\nown, there was no necessity whatsoever for them to seek finance from\n\nthe plaintiff's father and as such, it is only the figment of imagination of\n\nthe plaintiff that he is entitle for 1/6th share in said the plaint schedule -\n\n3B property and the said claim of the plaintiff is denied. Even\n\notherwise said property has been sold by the defendant No.2 in the year\n\n2002 to the knowledge of the plaintiff and the very fact that the\n\nplaintiff did not raise his title finger with respect to joint acquisition of\n\nthe same in the year 1995 by the defendants No.1 and 2 and disposing\n\nof the same in the year 2002, would further speak in volumes to the fact\n\nthat the claim now sought to be put forward by the plaintiff with\n\nrespect to the said property is after thought and obviously in order to\n\nharass and tease the defendants. That regarding additional plaint\n                                    62\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nallegations contained in paragraph 4B of the plaint the plaintiff tries to\n\napprobate and reprobate in his contentions regarding the very execution\n\nof the WILL. In one breath the plaintiff contends that his father died\n\nintestate and that he did not execute the WILL relied upon by the\n\ndefendants. In another breath for the sake of taking undue advantage of\n\nthe situation, the plaintiff claims 1/6th share in the compensation\n\namount alleged to have been received by defendant No.2 from the\n\nowner of the premises bearing No.100, Subedhar Chatram Road,\n\nBangalore-560020. The very dual contention of the plaintiff in this\n\nregard WILL lend support to the authenticity, genuineness, truthfulness\n\nand execution of the WILL relied upon by the defendants in their\n\nwritten statement. The defendant emphatically denies the allegation of\n\nthe plaintiff that he has received any compensation from the owner of\n\nthe afore-said premises much less sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as contended\n\nby the plaintiff. In fact pursuant to the terms of the WILL, the\n\ndefendant No.2 was alone treated as tenant of the afore-said premises\n\nby the owner of the said premises by receiving the monthly rental of\n\nRs.60/- per month and since the premises in question was not useful to\n                                    63\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe defendant No.2, he was constrained to surrender the same in favour\n\nof his landlord who instituted suit in OS.No.6971/2005 for eviction of\n\nthe premises as against the defendant No.2 alone and for consequential\n\nrelief of mesne profit at the rate of Rs.1,500/- per month. Under the\n\ncircumstances stated above, claim of the plaintiff to an extent of his\n\nalleged 1/6th share being Rs.1,66,666/- together with interest at the rate\n\nof 18% p.a. is false, frivolous and most speculative in nature.\n\n\n30)    The defendant No.3 counsel filed memo on 2/07/2009 adopting\n\nthe additional written statement filed by defendants No.1 and 2 in\n\nO.S.No.2731/2002 as additional written statement of defendant No.3.\n\nThe defendant No.7 in O.S.No.2731/2002 has filed written statement.\n\nBut the plaintiff in O.S.No.2731/2002 filed memo stating that he give\n\nup his claim over plaint schedule 3(B) property which belongs to\n\ndefendant No.7 and he prays to release defendant No.7 from the case as\n\nthe same withdrawn by the plaintiff. The defendant No.7 counsel\n\nsubmitted to accept the memo filed by the plaintiff counsel.

There is common question of law and fact. In order\n\nto avoid unnecessary and lengthy cross examination and multiplicity of\n\nproceedings, it appears that it would be just and proper to club this suit\n\n[OS.No.157432001]         with     OS.No.2731/2002         and      hence\n\nOS.No.15743/2001 is ordered to be clubbed with OS.No.2731/2002\n\nand it is ordered that there shall be common evidence.\n\n\n34)    The defendant No.2 in O.S.No.2731/2002 examined as DW.1 on\n\n07/04/2007 and further examined on 27/06/2013 and further examined\n\non 08/03/2019 and marked documents ExD1 to ExD181.

The defendant No.6 is the Bank in which\n\nthe father of the plaintiff has deposited Rs.15,00,000/- under\n\nNegotiable Certificate of deposit. He is seeking for direction to the\n\nBank not to pay the amount to the defendants alone and hence he had\n\nimpleaded the defendant No.6 as formal party. That his father hailed\n\nfrom Bilara of Jodhpur District in the State of Rajasthan and after\n\ncoming to Bangalore, he married defendant No.1 in the year 1960.\n                                   72\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nThat his father inherited only an ancestral house situated at Bilara\n\nVillage, Jodhpur District, Rajasthan measuring approximately 1200\n\nsquare feet. The said house is under lock and there is no income from\n\nthe said property. After coming to Bangalore his father started an Auto\n\nFinance Business, out of said business, his father earned lot of\n\nimmovable and movable properties as described in the schedule of the\n\nplaint.\n\n\n39)       The PW.1 further deposed evidence that he is carrying on the\n\nbusiness of Auto Finance and defendants No.2 and 3 are also carrying\n\non own business of Auto Finance under Bohra Finance Pvt., Ltd., and\n\nearning their livelihood. Even defendant No.1 is carrying on Auto\n\nFinance Business under the name and style of Surekhadevi Financier\n\nAutomotive and has got earnings of her own. The defendants No.4 and\n\n5 are his sisters and they are married and living with their respective\n\nhusbands. The marriage of daughters was performed by his father by\n\ntaking his help. Earlier he and defendants No.1 to 5 were residing with\n\nhis father at No.104, Railway Parallel Road, Kumara Park West,\n\nBangalore, it was a rented house. He married in the year 1989 and\n                                   73\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthereafter his wife and defendant No.1 had no good relationship, hence\n\nhis mother was pestering his father to send him out of the house\n\nregularly. There was frequent quarrel in the family created by the\n\ndefendant No.1 and hence to avoid unnecessary disturbance in the\n\nfamily and to main good relationship he decided to stay separately. He\n\nshifted to rented premises at Malleshwaram in the year 1992. In the\n\nsame year his father purchased the property bearing Site No.15\n\nmeasuring 40 x 60 feet at 8th Main Road, Vasantha Nagar West\n\nExtension, Bangalore-560052 with constructed building thereon. The\n\nbuilding consists of ground floor and first floor with two car garage on\n\nthe right and left side of the building. The ground floor was purchased\n\nby father of the plaintiff in the name of defendant No.1 for valuable\n\nconsideration of Rs.6,00,000/- on 22/08/1992. The entire consideration\n\nwas paid by his father alone. Subsequently on 11/11/1992 his father\n\npurchased the first floor portion of the same property for valuable\n\nconsideration of Rs.6,50,000/-, the said property is schedule item No.1\n\nof the plaint. At the time of purchase there was a tenant namely Surya\n\nlamps Limited in occupation of the Ground floor on a monthly rent of\n                                   74\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nRs.5,500/-. In fact relationship between his father and defendant No.1\n\nwas not cordial. His father purchased the ground floor portion in the\n\nname of defendant No.1 with view to provide her stability and also\n\nprovide capital for her to start her own Auto Finance Business and thus\n\nthe defendant No.1 has started an Auto Finance Business in the name\n\nand style \"Surekhadevi Financier Automotive\".\n\n\n40)        The PW.1 further deposed that the defendants No.1 to 3\n\nfrequently quarreling with his father for money. To maintain the dignity\n\nof the family, his father made provision for income to the defendants\n\nNo.1 to 3 by providing them necessary capital to start their own\n\nbusiness. The tenant who had occupied the ground floor of property\n\npurchased by his father on 22/08/1992 vacated the same in the year\n\n1993. Till then his father was carrying on the business in the suit\n\nschedule item No.1. Since there was no separate premise available,\n\neven the defendants No.1 to 3 had also carried their respective business\n\nin the suit schedule item No.1 property. Since the ground floor was in\n\noccupation of tenant, the Suit Schedule Item No.1 was kept by his\n\nfather and defendants No.1 to 3 were carrying on business. The\n                                    75\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 were always in inimical towards him and also his\n\nfather's money. The defendants No.1 to 3 were not tolerating even he\n\ntalks to his father. The marriage of defendant No.4 was performed in\n\nthe year 1995. After marriage of defendant No.4 difference between his\n\nfather and defendants No.1 to 4 increased leading to a total breakdown\n\nof peace and tranquility. His father was suffering from diabetes and\n\nHypertension and due to the ill treatment from defendants No.1 to 3, he\n\nwas undergoing lot of suffering and pain. In fact he was undergoing\n\ntension and anxiety and suffered a fall sustaining injury. Therefore his\n\nfather was compelled to leave the first floor and started stay in the\n\nground floor taking food from outside. Nobody looked after his father\n\nand he was not being allowed to look after his father. Since the\n\nproperty is self acquired property of his father, and his father was very\n\nmuch reluctant to come and stay with him in the rented property at\n\nMalleshwaram. Therefore on the advice of the well wishers of the\n\nfamily, looking at the suffering of his father, the well wishers of the\n\nfamily advised his father and sort of settlement was arrived at between\n\nthe defendants No.1 to 3 and his father on 22/02/1996. On the basis of\n                                     76\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe said settlement, the defendants No.1 to 3 shifted from first floor to\n\nthe ground floor. The defendant No.1 and his father decided not to live\n\nseparately as they mutually agreed to live separate for rest of their life.\n\nUnder the said settlement defendant No.1 was paid Rs.5,00,000/- and\n\ndefendants No.2 and 3 were paid Rs.10,00,000/- each by his father.\n\nThus in 1996 the defendants No.1 to 3 were residing in the ground\n\nfloor and his father alone was staying in the first floor. Even though his\n\nfather was staying alone in the first floor there was no peace of mind to\n\nhis father due to the ill treatment meted out by the defendants No.1 to 3\n\nin 1994 the land lord of the premises in which he was residing at\n\nMalleshwaram filed an eviction petition against him in HRC\n\nNo.2329/1994 which came to be allowed on 25/05/1998. Against the\n\nsaid order he preferred appeal in Revision petition in HRRP\n\nNo.178/1998. The said revision petition came to be dismissed on\n\n17/08/1998. However the court had granted time to him till February\n\n2000 to vacate and hand over the possession to the landlord. Since he\n\nhad no other property to stay, his father asked him to come and stay\n\nwith him in the first floor i.e. suit schedule item No.1 property. Thus he\n                                    77\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nshifted his residence to the suit schedule item No.1 in the year 2000.\n\nHis father's health deteriorated fully and hence as per the advice of the\n\ndoctor, he was constrained to shift to the ground floor and till his death\n\nhe was staying in the ground floor. The defendants No.2 and 3 after\n\ntaking the money from his father purchased the property bearing\n\nNo.173 in which they started staying separately.\n\n\n41)     The PW.1 further deposed that the schedule properties are self\n\nacquired properties of his father. His father died intestate and therefore\n\nhe and defendants No.1 to 5 have got equal share in respect of the\n\nschedule properties. The defendants No.1 to 3 with an intention to\n\ndeprive his legitimate share stated claiming that his father executed\n\nWILL and bequeathed all his properties in favour of defendants No.1 to\n\n3. Further they started insisting him to vacate the premises. His father\n\nhad made deposit in Global Trust Bank Limited, in two Negotiable\n\nCertificate of Deposit bearing Nos.150254289 and 150254293 for\n\namount of Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- respectively. These\n\ndeposited were matured on 29/11/2000 and 11/12/2000. The defendant\n\nNo.1 made attempt to withdraw the amount without his knowledge. It\n                                   78\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nappears the defendant No.6 requested the defendant No.1 to produce\n\nthe succession certificate for paying the amount in the name of\n\ndefendant   No.1.    Therefore    defendant   No.1    filed   suit    in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001 seeking for mandatory injunction against defendant\n\nNo.6 directing the Bank to pay the amount in her favour. When the\n\nbank refused to make payment, the defendant No.1 referred to WILL\n\nalleged to have been executed by his father, has not produced the same\n\nin the suit. He came to know about this and immediately made an\n\napplication in O.S.No.15743/2001 to implead him as party. In fact his\n\napplication was allowed and he was impleaded as defendant No.2 in\n\nthe said suit. The alleged WILL is concocted and created and his father\n\nnever executed any WILL. The signature on the alleged WILL must\n\nhave been forged or must have been obtained by coercion. His father\n\nnever intended to bequeath the property. In fact there relationship\n\nbetween his father and defendants No.1 to 3 was not cordial. The\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 must have created a concocted WILL only to\n\ndeprive him of his legitimate share in respect of the schedule\n\nproperties. There was no love and affection between his father and\n                                     79\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 because of the constant harassment given by\n\ndefendants No.2 to 3 to his father. That his father also filed criminal\n\ncase against the defendants No.1 to 3 and even the recitals made in the\n\nMemorandum of understanding dated 22/02/1996 clearly shows that\n\nthere is no cordiality love and affection between his father and the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3. In the year 1996 his father went to pilgrimage in\n\nNorth Indian religious places. At that time as his health condition was\n\nnot good, he had given a letter to the Manager of Indian Bank,\n\nSadashivanagar Branch, Bangalore-3 nominating him in respect of the\n\nlocker maintained by him. In view of the false claim made by the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 he constrained to seek partition and separate\n\npossession of 1/5th share in respect of the suit schedule properties,\n\nwhich are self acquired properties of his father.\n\n\n42)     The PW.1 further deposed that the cause of action for the suit\n\narose from 18/11/2000 when his father expired and subsequently when\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 started insisting him to vacate the premises by\n\nconcocting the story of WILL in O.S.No.15743/2001. Since he\n\ndemanded for partition and separate possession, the defendants are\n                                     80\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ntrying to take law into their own hands and trying to disturb his\n\npossession of in respect of suit schedule item No.1 and he is seeking\n\ninjunction against defendants. His father has got several bank accounts\n\nand particulars of those accounts are in the custody of defendant No.1\n\nand defendant No.1 is trying to withdraw the amount in those accounts\n\nand it appears she has already utilized part of the amount lying in those\n\naccounts. His father advanced money to several borrowers and\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 have realized the said amount from the borrowers.\n\nHe is entitle for share in the amount so realized. Since all the\n\nparticulars regarding these transactions are with defendants No.1 to 3,\n\nhence he is seeking for mesne profits also. The PW.1 further deposed\n\nthat it is false to state that he is staying in the suit schedule item No.1\n\non leave and licence basis. He is not liable to pay any licence fee as\n\nalleged in the written statement. The alleged khata produced by the\n\ndefendants is obtained behind back of him on the basis of concocted\n\nWILL and same has no sanctity in law. He has not given any no\n\nobjection for transfer of khata in respect of the schedule item No.1\n\nproperty solely in the name of defendant No.1. The alleged WILL is\n                                   81\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ncreated by defendants No.1 to 3 to cloud equal share to him out of the\n\nproperties left behind his father. His father was suffering from serious\n\nillness since 1996 and ultimately died on 18/11/2000. The garage\n\nportion attached to the suit schedule item No.1 is in him occupation.\n\nHe is in occupation of the entire premises of suit schedule item No.1\n\nincluding garage. The defendants after creating WILL broke open the\n\nwall attached to the garage portion from the ground floor and started\n\nmaking claim that garage is in their possession. There is no entrance to\n\nthe garage in his occupation from the ground floor. After coming know\n\nabout that he has also filed complaint and an FIR was also registered\n\nfor an offence of trespass against the defendants No.1 to 3, the counter\n\nclaim made by the defendants are all false, frivolous and vexatious. The\n\nPW.1 prays to decree to decree the suit as prayed in the plaint and\n\nreject the counter claim. In support of oral evidence PW.1 marked the\n\ndocuments ExP1 to ExP109.\n\n\n43)       The PW.1/plaintiff in OS.No.2731/2002 Dinesh Singh S/o\n\nSampath Singh Bohra has filed his additional affidavit in lieu of\n\nexamination chief on 02/11/2010 and deposed evidence that an\n                                     82\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nadditional issue as to \"Whether the property bearing No.45, 7th cross,\n\nHMT layout, Vishweswaraiah Nagar, Gangenahalli, Bangalore is liable\n\nfor partition as contended by defendants No.1 to 3\" has been framed on\n\n13/01/2010. This particular property belongs to his wife absolutely. He\n\nis an income tax assessee right from 1977-78. His marriage took place\n\nwith her on 24/05/1989. She has sold her jewellery, diamond and gold\n\nand also paid income tax. The ground floor of plaint schedule 1A was\n\npurchased by his mother's name nominally. But entire consideration\n\nwas paid by his father and it is his father's self acquired property.\n\nSimilarly another property bearing No.1, 7 th cross, 8th main Road,\n\nMalleswaram Bangalore measuring 3000 square feet i.e. schedule 1B\n\nproperty was purchased by his father in his mother's name, the entire\n\nconsideration for purchase of said properly flowed only by his father.\n\nThis property was also purchased by his father in the name of his\n\nmother nominally. It does not belong to her absolutely and liable for\n\npartition. The defendant No.1 always assured him that the schedule 1A\n\nand 1B properties are belong to all the legal heirs his father and that she\n\nwould not act against the interests of any of the legal heirs. These\n                                     83\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nproperties belongs to joint family and he is entitle to 1/6th share in\n\nthese two properties. The auto finance business was being run by his\n\nfather in the name of his mother and she was only a house wife. She\n\nhad no power or authority to gift this property to the defendant No.2.\n\nHis father purchased plaint schedule 3A property in the name of\n\ndefendant No.2 nominally. His father gave sum of Rs.10,00,000/- to the\n\ndefendant No.2 and asked him to buy the said property for the joint\n\nfamily. The properties mentioned in schedule 1& 1A were purchased\n\nby his father and the property mentioned in schedule 3A is situated just\n\nbehind the properties mentioned in schedule 1& 1A, which is a single\n\nbuilding, both properties are adjacent to each other measuring totally\n\n4800 square feet. His father was not well and defendant No.2 asked his\n\nfather to pay funds for purchase of schedule 3A property. His father\n\nnever believed the defendants and hence he paid and took a receipt for\n\nthis payment. The defendant No.2 does not possess absolute right over\n\nthis property and entitle 1/6th share in this property and he is entitle for\n\n1/6th share in this property.\n                                    84\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n44)       The PW.1 further deposed that out his own funds his father\n\npurchased plaint schedule 3B property, but sale deed registered\n\nnominally in the name of defendants No.1 & 2. This property has been\n\nsold to defendant No.7 by the defendants No.1 & 2 without his consent\n\nand authority. He is entitled for 1/6th share in this property. His father\n\ntaken schedule-7 shop premises on rent. Without his consent and\n\napproval, the defendant No.2 has handed over the premises to the\n\nlandlord after accepting Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation from the\n\nlandlord. As the defendant No.2 earning profits out of this sum of\n\nRs.10,00,000/-, hence he is entitle to mesne profits. Hence he is entitle\n\nto receive 1/6th share in this sum of Rs.10,00,000/- along with mesne\n\nprofits from the defendant No.2. The PW.1 prays to decree suit in his\n\nfavour.\n\n\n45)        The PW.1/plaintiff in O.S.No.2731/2002 Dinesh Singh S/o\n\nSampath Singh Bohra has filed his additional affidavit in lieu of\n\nexamination in chief as PW.1A on 29/09/2018 and deposed evidence\n\nthat defendants have produced fabricated WILL alleged to have been\n\nregistered in the Sub-Registrar's office on 01/07/2000. He was residing\n                                    85\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nin the first floor of the premises where in the ground floor his mother\n\nand others were residing. On the same day on 01/07/2000 his father\n\nwas seriously ill and he got the information of his son-in-law of\n\nMangalchand by name Champalalji Bantia died at young age of 49\n\nyears. Mangalchand is first cousin of his father and he was a frequent\n\nvisitor to their house and he was also fast friend and close relative to\n\ntheir father. He was Sampath Singh's father Lalchand Bohra's elder\n\nbrother Ganeshmal Bohra's son. His father was staying in the ground\n\nfloor under doctor's advice and he was shocked to hear the death of\n\nChampalal at young age. Already he was not even in a position to stand\n\nupon his feet properly due to deteriorated health conditions. But he sent\n\nwords to him to take him to the funeral ceremonies of the deceased\n\nperson. He had to take him to the residence of late Champalal Bantia\n\nand also he had to take care of him, they were their till 4 pm. It is\n\ncustomary in their community to perform \"Utavana\" on the 3 rd day of\n\ndeath. In the lease deed dated 26/07/1970 executed by late Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra in favour of Mahboob Beig, he signed as 'S S Bohra' and\n\nin the agreement to sell dated 24/09/1992 late Sampath Singh Bohra\n                                   86\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhas signed as 'S S Bohra' and in the original partnership deed dated\n\n24/09/1998 between Sampath Singh Bohra              and A.V.Anantha\n\nPadmanabha, late Sampath Singh Bohar has signed as 'S S Bohra'. His\n\nfather used to sign all registrable documents as 'S S Bohra\" and he\n\nnever used to sign in any other manner on registrable documents.\n\nTherefore the WILL is fabricated and forged. The WILL has come into\n\nexistence under suspicious circumstances. The defendants No.1 to 3\n\nhad developed so much hatred and animosity towards him and his\n\nfamily that they hated to call him as son of his parents. They had\n\ndecided to make sure that he do not get any property, either movable or\n\nimmovable belonging to his father and therefore, they have fabricated\n\nthe alleged WILL giving nothing to him. His father stayed with him for\n\nabout 9 months in 1996. He had already revealed in his evidence the\n\ncriminal antecedents of defendants No.2 & 3. Now he remembered\n\nrecently one more such criminal act of defendant No.2 and he had\n\nobtained certified copy of FIR in Crime No.192/94 wherein defendant\n\nNo.2 has been charged with the offence of forgery and cheating. He\n\nused to even forge signatures of his parents which criminal act was\n                                   87\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ntacitly supported by his mother. He and his father repeatedly advise his\n\nyounger brothers in this regards. These are reasons why he came to\n\nhated by his mother and younger brothers. In support of oral evidence\n\nPW.1A marked ExP110 to ExP123. The plaintiff counsel got marked\n\nExP124 through confrontation in the evidence of DW.2.\n\n\n46)   The defendant No.2 in O.S.No.2731/2002 Lokesh Singh S/o Late\n\nSampath Singh Bohra filed his affidavit evidence in lieu of\n\nexamination in chief as DW.1 on 06/10/2007 and deposed evidence that\n\nhe is son and Power of Attorney Holder of defendant No.1 executed by\n\ndefendant No.1 in his favour on 10/11/2006. It is fact that late Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra is husband of defendant No.1 and the father of plaintiff\n\nand defendants No.2 to 5 and the relationship between the parties as\n\nmentioned by the plaintiff is correct. His late father died intestate on\n\n18/11/2000. That his father made last WILL and Testament on\n\n01/07/2000 while he was in a sound and disposing state of mind and\n\nhealth and in full control of his physical and mental faculties. His\n\nfather made his WILL of his own volition and without any coercion or\n\nundue influence being exerted on him by any person as borne out by\n                                     88\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe fact that he has made fair and equal bequests to all his immediate\n\nfamily members, i.e., his wife and five children, and the plaintiff is also\n\na beneficiary under the said WILL and has taken his share of the\n\nproperty bequeathed to him there under and is how estopped from\n\nfalsely contending that his father died intestate.\n\n\n47)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that said WILL was also\n\nduly attested by two witnesses by name, N.P. Ganapathi and N.P\n\nSubbaiah, and the same was also registered on 26/07/2000 by the Sub-\n\nRegistrar, Gandhinagar, Bangalore, as Document No.87/2000-01 at\n\nPages 230 to 248 in Volume 197 of Book III. There are no suspicious\n\ncircumstances surrounding the making of the said WILL and the\n\ngenuineness and validity of the WILL are beyond doubt. Thus his late\n\nfather's WILL reflects his true intention and desire in the matter of\n\ndisposition of his estate and he did not die intestate entitling the\n\nplaintiff to claim partition of our late father's properties and assets on\n\nthe basis of alleged intestate succession.\n                                    89\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n48)     The DW.1 further deposed that his mother defendant No.1 had\n\nfiled OS.No.15743/2001 against defendant No.6 which is now clubbed\n\nwith the above suit. The subject matter of the said suit is two deposits\n\nthat his father had made with defendant No.6 when he was alive and\n\nwhich are described in Schedule-4 to the plaint in this suit. His mother\n\nhad filed the aforesaid suit originally against Global Trust Bank Ltd.\n\nSeeking the relief of a mandatory injunction directing them to give\n\neffect to certain nominations that his late father had made with the said\n\nBank in respect of the Schedule-4 property. Consequent to the merger\n\nof the said Bank with the Oriental Bank of Commerce, the plaint in the\n\nsaid was amended and the said Oriental Bank of Commerce was\n\nbrought on record as defendant No.6 in the said suit vide an order dated\n\n16/01/2006. Prior thereto his brother Dinesh Singh the plaintiff of this\n\nsuit had also impleaded himself as defendant No.2 in the said suit vide\n\nan order dated 02/01/2002. So far as the Schedule-4 property is\n\nconcerned, his late father had deposited sum of Rs.7,00,000/- with\n\ndefendant No.6 under a certificate of deposit bearing No.150254289\n\ndated 29/08/2000 maturing on 29/11/2000. His father had also\n                                    90\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndeposited a further sum of Rs.8,00,000/- with defendant No.6 under a\n\nCertificate of Deposit bearing No.150254293 dated 09/09/2000\n\nmaturing on 11/12/2000. These deposits were made during the lifetime\n\nof my father who passed away on 18/11/2000, prior to the dates of\n\nmaturity of the Schedule 4 deposits on 29/11/2000 and 11/12/2000,\n\nrespectively.\n\n\n49)   The DW.1 further deposed that his late father had nominated his\n\nmother defendant No.1 to receive the amounts of the Schedule 4\n\ndeposits with defendant No.6 when the same matured. This is admitted\n\nby defendant No.6 at para 3 of its Written Statement in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001. He is advised to submit that his mother as the\n\nnominee would be entitle to receive the amounts of such matured\n\ndeposits and hold the same in trust for all the legal heirs of his late\n\nfather who would be the beneficiaries of his estate in the event he died\n\nwithout leaving WILL or other testamentary disposition, i.e., in the\n\nevent of intestate succession. He is further advised to submit that extent\n\nthe stand taken by defendant No.6 in the aforesaid to that extent the\n\nstand taken by defendant No.6 in the aforesaid suit may be correct that\n                                     91\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nsince there are legal heirs of his late father, his mother is not entitle to\n\nreceive the value of the matured deposits held by defendant No.6.\n\nHowever the true and correct fact is that his father died leaving the\n\naforesaid WILL dated 01/07/2000 which is also registered before the\n\njurisdictional Sub-Registrar. In the said Will his father has made\n\nvarious bequests in respect of his movable and immovable properties\n\nand assets in favour of his mother and all his children. However his late\n\nfather did not make any specific bequests in respect of the two deposits\n\nwith defendant No.6 which are described in Schedule-4 to the plaint in\n\nthis suit for the reason that these deposits were made on 29/08/2000\n\nand 09/09/2000, i.e., after his father had made his WILL dated\n\n01/07/2000. However in Clause 19 of the said WILL dated 01/07/2000\n\nhis mother has been named as the residuary legatee of his father's\n\nestate, that is to say that any specific items of his father's assets and\n\nproperties not specifically bequeathed in the said WILL would devolve\n\nupon my mother as such residuary legatee. For easy of reference he\n\nreproducing Clause 19 of my late father's WILL \"I have recorded all\n\nmy assets in this Will and in case any movable or immovable has been\n                                    92\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nleft out by inadvertence or if any other movables or immovables which\n\nhe may acquire subsequent to this Will shall devolve on my wife\n\nMrs.Surekhadevi after my death\".\n\n\n50)    The DW.1 further deposed that as on the date of death of his\n\nfather if he is in possession of any cash, jewelry, movable or\n\nimmovable properties on hand, the same shall devolve upon his wife\n\nSurekhadevi. Accordingly the two deposits with defendant No.6\n\ndescribed in Schedule-4 devolved upon his mother and she is solely\n\nentitled to receive the same as the admitted nominee thereof and to\n\nappropriate the same to herself as the sole legatee thereof as such\n\ndeposits were made by his late father after making his aforesaid WILL\n\ndated 01/07/2000. The Plaintiff got himself impleaded as defendant\n\nNo.2 in OS.No.15743/2001 vide an order dated 02/01/2002. That the\n\nsaid suit has now been clubbed with the above suit as it is only a\n\nresiduary of the above suit. Despite knowing and being fully aware of\n\nthe subject matter of the suit in OS.No.15743/2001, the plaintiff herein\n\nchose to file the above suit in respect of the same subject matter as\n\ncontained in OS.No.15743/2001 and has also falsely averred in para\n                                    93\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nNo.8 of the plaint in this suit stating that \"There is no pending of any\n\nlegal proceedings and litigations either past or present concerning any\n\npart of the subject matter of this plaint in any court within the\n\nknowledge of the plaintiff\". This is nothing but blatant falsehood on the\n\npart of the plaintiff to make out a case where none exists. Except for\n\nthe house at Rajasthan described in Schedule-6 to the plaint all the\n\nproperties both movable and immovable as detailed in the Schedules to\n\nthe plaint in this suit were the self acquired properties of their late\n\nfather. That the Ground Floor of the house property situated at 8 th Main\n\nRoad, 1st Cross, Vasanthanagar, Bangalore. The First Floor of which is\n\ndescribed in Schedule-1 to the plaint is the self-earned property of\n\ndefendant No.1 and the said Ground Floor property, which bears\n\nseparate Municipal No.37, was purchased by defendant No.1 out of her\n\nfunds and she is the absolute owner and Khatedar of the same and the\n\nsame is in the exclusive possession of defendant No.1. That the\n\nSchedule 1 property, i.e., the First Floor of the said house at 8 th Main,\n\n1st Cross, Vasanthanagar, bearing Municipal No.37/1, was purchased by\n                                    94\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ntheir late father from and out of his own funds and as such is self\n\nacquired property.\n\n\n51)    The DW.1 further deposed that the relationship between his late\n\nfather and his mother was cordial during the lifetime of his late father.\n\nThat the plaintiff along with his family, myself and defendants No.1, 3\n\nto 5 herein along with his deceased father lived together as Joint\n\nFamily till 26/3/1992 when the plaintiff at the instigation of his wife\n\nabruptly and voluntarily left the Joint Family house at Kumara Park at\n\nabout 5 a.m. and started residing in a rented at Malleshwaram where he\n\ncontinued to reside till February 2000. The Plaintiff then requested his\n\nlate father for temporary accommodation in the Schedule-I property\n\nfor just about three months on the ground that there was an eviction\n\norder against him in respect of the Malleswaram house where he was\n\nliving and that the house purchased by him at R.T. Nagar required\n\nrepairs and renovations. That the plaintiff was provided with\n\nRs.10,00,000/- by his late father in November 1995, with an addition of\n\nRs.3,00,000/- from his HUF to his wife's account to purchased the said\n\nhouse at R.T.Nagar. The plaintiff purchased the R.T. Nagar house for\n                                   95\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nmore than Rs.10,00,000/- and on the plea that it required repairs and\n\nrenovation sought and got leave and licence from their late father for a\n\nthree month stay in Schedule-I property, but continued to stay herein\n\nillegally even after the death of his late father. The leave and licence\n\nwas restricted to the Schedule-I property (less two rooms) and did not\n\ncover the garage attached to the Ground Floor, which was in the\n\npossession of our late father and which continues to be in the\n\npossession of defendant No.1 after the death of his father. The said\n\ngarage has also an entrance from the Ground Floor property bearing\n\nNo.37 since more than eight years. The Ground Floor bearing No.37\n\nand the Floor bearing No.37/1, i.e., the plaint Schedule-I property are\n\nin fact interlinked from the inside of the premises itself by common\n\nstaircase on the Ground Floor and terminating at the main entrance of\n\nthe First Floor. Thus these two premises are one composite premises\n\nand not two separate and independent premises as sought to be made\n\nout by the Plaintiff. Under the WILL of their late father the Schedule-I\n\nproperty is bequeathed to defendant No.1 by way of a life interest\n\nfollowed by the same going to defendant No.3 on the demise of\n                                    96\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendant No.1 and defendant No.3 then acquiring absolute ownership\n\nthereof. Thus on the death of our late father on 18/11/2000 the entire\n\nSchedule-I property vested with defendant No.1 as one of the\n\nbeneficiaries of the said WILL and the plaintiffs occupation thereof\n\nafter the death of our late father is illegal and unlawful since the leave\n\nand licence elapsed after the death of our late father and got\n\nautomatically revoked. The plaintiff is continuing to occupy the\n\nSchedule-I property under revoked licence and defendant No.1 has\n\nbecome the owner of the same under the WILL of her late husband.\n\nHence defendant No.1 is entitle to seek possession of the Schedule-I\n\nproperty through direction by means of decree of mandatory injunction,\n\ncalling upon the plaintiff to cease using and occupying Schedule-I\n\nproperty and to permit its use and occupation by defendant No.1. Thus\n\ndefendant No.1 has made counter claim n this suit seeking such other\n\nreliefs. There was any estrangement between his mother and late\n\nfather during his lifetime. The plaintiff's allegations of non-cooperation\n\nand quarrels between them or any of the other family members are\n\ntravesty of truth. It is false that the children of their late father were\n                                     97\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nsilenced through payments allegedly made to them by him for starting\n\ntheir own businesses. They have been doing business on their own and\n\nwith their skill and enterprise commenced and developed their\n\nindividual businesses. It is false that after the marriage of defendant\n\nNo.4 these alleged differences and quarrels between the children and\n\nthe father escalated and that he was ill-treated by his children leading to\n\nincrease in his hypertension and diabetes. It is true that his father\n\ncontinued to reside in the Schedule-I property and he was doing\n\nbusiness in the Ground Floor of the said property and it is utterly false\n\nthat he was not being provided home food and that he was getting food\n\nfrom outside. The Plaintiffs repeated allegations that his children\n\nallegedly treated their father with cruelty and the resultant mental\n\nagony that he purportedly suffered have their origin in plaintiffs\n\nperverse mind to create prejudice against defendants No.1 to 5. On the\n\nother hand his late father was not at all willing to stay at any time with\n\nthe plaintiff in the plaintiffs rented house at Malleswaram, as he did not\n\nappreciate the plaintiff's attitude and aggressive behavior towards the\n                                     98\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nother members of his family. The plaintiff was at loggerheads with his\n\nfather and there was bad blood between them.\n\n\n52.      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that it was in fact the\n\nplaintiff who all along had callous and disrespectful attitude towards\n\nour father and is now making allegations against defendants No.1 to 5\n\nto cover up his own familial offences. To satisfy his late father and to\n\nprevent any deterioration in his health, and as per his wise, the plaintiff\n\nand defendants No.1 to 5 signed what our late father told us was\n\nMemorandum of Understanding. This Memorandum of Understanding\n\nwas to abide by our late father's wishes in the matter and out of utmost\n\nrespect for him we just signed the said document being unaware of its\n\ncontents and not at all getting any benefit or advantage there from. This\n\nwas done under pressure from certain relatives, who insisted on us\n\ndoing so on the ground that it would be in the interest of the family and\n\nthe wellbeing of our late father. However to the best of his knowledge,\n\nthe plaintiff and defendants No.1 to 5 had signed on all the sheets/pages\n\nof the said Memorandum of Understanding and the document now\n\nproduced by the Plaintiff purporting to be the same MOU does not\n                                    99\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ncontain our signatures on all the sheets / pages. They have every reason\n\nto believe that the Plaintiff has substituted the original document that\n\nwe signed with concocted document for the purpose of this case and to\n\ngain an illegal unfair advantage and benefit over his late father's\n\nproperties.\n\n\n53)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that there was no shifting\n\nby defendants No.1 to 5 to the Ground Floor of the Schedule-I property\n\nin pursuance of the alleged Memorandum of Understanding. As in the\n\ncase of the said MOU and to please their late father and to avoid any\n\nbitterness, defendants No.1 to 3 signed receipts referring therein to\n\nsome payments, which in fact these defendants did not receive. All this\n\nhappened under the honest belief entertained by his family members\n\nthat if we did not sign, no matter we got no benefit from their doing so,\n\nthere would be disharmony and even disaster if something happened to\n\ntheir late father consequent to his indifferent health. The Memorandum\n\nof Understanding dated 22/02/1996 did not purport to create or operate\n\nas final settlement of the properties and assets of our late father\n\namongst himself and his family members. The said MOU is an\n                                    100\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nunregistered document and cannot affect the immovable properties and\n\nassets of their late father or, indeed, any of his other properties and\n\nassets and was never acted upon. The registered WILL dated\n\n01/07/2000 is the final and binding testament of their late father and the\n\ndisposition of his estate must be made in accordance with the said\n\nWILL and not in accordance with intestate succession or any prior or\n\nproceeding document much less the unregistered MOU relief on by the\n\nplaintiff which, as stated earlier, also does not appear to be the same\n\nMOU that we recall signing.\n\n\n54)       The DW.1 further deposed that as regards the stay of the\n\nplaintiff in the Schedule 1 property from February 2000, this was by\n\nway of temporary licenced accommodation on the twin grounds of an\n\neviction order suffered by him in respect of the rented Malleshwaram\n\nproperty where he was earlier staying and the non-completion of the\n\nplaintiffs own bungalow and R.T.Nagar. The Plaintiffs stay in the\n\nSchedule 1 property was not in his own right and plaintiff was not\n\naccommodation in the whole of the Schedule-1 property but in the First\n\nFloor less two rooms and the Garage in the Ground Floor. These two\n                                    101\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nrooms contained his late father's documents and personal articles and\n\nthe Plaintiff subsequently unlocked these rooms and removed the said\n\narticles and documents. After his late father's death the plaintiff has\n\noccupied the other two rooms also, but the garage continues to be in\n\noccupation of defendant No.1. In fact as stated by the Plaintiff himself\n\nin para No.4 of the plaint, till his death our late father was residing in\n\nthe Ground Floor. The plaintiff has himself, along with his family\n\nmembers, shifted out of the Schedule-1 property to his own house in\n\nR.T.Nagar sometime in January / February 2006.\n\n\n55)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that it is false that the\n\nproperty bearing No.173, 1st Cross, 8th Main, Vasanthanagar was\n\npurchased by defendants No.2 and 3 with money allegedly got from\n\nour late father. In fact it was purchased only by himself with his own\n\nearnings and not through any alleged payment to him by his late father.\n\nThus this premises bearing No.173 is my self-acquisition and it was not\n\nacquired in the mode and manner alleged by the plaintiff.\n\n\n56)     The DW.1 further deposed evidence that in terms of the WILL\n\ndated 01/07/2000 left by their late father, he bequeathed Schedule-1 of\n                                     102\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe plaint Schedule properties to his wife defendant No.1 to have a life\n\ninterest therein after which the same goes to defendant No.3 and the\n\nabsolute owner thereof; the Schedule-2 property is bequeathed jointly\n\nto defendants No.4 and-5 who are the two daughters of our late father;\n\nthe Schedule 3 property have been bequeathed to the plaintiff\n\nabsolutely and he has been receiving rents from the tenant in\n\noccupation of the same since the date of death of our late father and\n\nthis property is valuable commercial property and its present market\n\nvalue is not less than Rs.10,00,000/- as stated above, Schedule-4 of the\n\nplaint Schedule properties being the deposits with defendant No.6 has\n\nbeen bequeathed absolutely to defendant No.1; the diamond bangles\n\ndescribed in Schedule 5 (i) and the Fiat Uno Car described in Schedule\n\n5 (ii) have been bequeathed to defendant No.1 and the Registration\n\nCertificate of this car has also been transferred to the name of\n\ndefendant No.1; Schedule 6 of the plaint Schedule properties which is\n\nthe ancestral property in Rajasthan has been bequeathed equally to the\n\nthree sons of their late father, viz, he, plaintiff and defendant No.3.\n                                    103\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n57).    The DW.1 further deposed evidence that as regards the S.B.A/c\n\nNo.17050 with Syndicate Bank described in Schedule 5(ii) the same is\n\nnot at all connected with his late father, but it is the personal account of\n\ntheir mother/defendant No.1 and the plaintiff cannot make a claim on\n\nthe same. Their late father's personal account in Syndicate Bank\n\nbearing S.B.A/c No.17047 had balance of Rs. 1,20,932=78ps as on the\n\ndate his death. This account also had their mother defendant No.1 as\n\nthe nominee and in terms of the WILL of their late father said amount\n\nhas gone to their mother as the legatee and beneficiary thereof. Their\n\nfather has current Account No.744 in his name as the Kartha of his\n\nHUF with the said Syndicate Bank and this is sought to be described in\n\nSchedule-5 (v) (d). The amount of Rs.4,30,491=35ps in this HUF\n\naccount has been withdrawn by defendant No.1 and further sum of\n\nRs.1,00,000/- was recovered from debtor by name Chandrakanth, who\n\nis named in Schedule 5 (v) (b) to the plaint. As the nominee of the HUF\n\naccount defendant No.1 is ready to pay Plaintiff 1/4 th share from this\n\ntotal capital of the HUF amounting to Rs.5,46,316=12ps. She has\n\nalready paid 1/4th share each from the same to defendant No.3 and to\n                                   104\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhim and she has retained her own 1/4th share. This amount is that\n\ndescribed in Schedule 5 (v) (d) to the plaint. The Cash on Hand\n\ndescribed in Schedule 5 (iv) is actually Rs.68,057=70ps and has also\n\nvested in their mother defendant No.1 in terms of his late father's WILL\n\ndated 01/07/2020.\n\n\n58)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that from the debtors of\n\nhis late father's business detailed in Schedule 5 (v) (a) (b) and (c), a\n\nsum of Rs.80,000/- was recovered from one Gopal Krishna on\n\n23/05/2001 and sum of Rs.1,32,000/- from one Chandrakanth on\n\n12/12/2001, 04/02/2002, 13/02/2002 and 18/02/2002. No amount is\n\ndue from Guru Sastri Mutt. As regards T.N.Suresh only sum of\n\nRs.4.50,000/- is due from him and the same is as good as lost and non-\n\nrecoverable, as the said T.N.Suresh is absconding and his whereabouts\n\nare not known. There is also complaint of cheating filed by their late\n\nfather against the said T.N.Suresh in the Bharatinagar Police Station.\n\nThe DW.1 further deposed evidence that the widow and all the children\n\nof the deceased Sampath Singh Bohra have all benefited equally from\n\nhis properties and assets. In fact the plaintiff may have benefited more\n                                    105\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhaving regard to the fact that almost Rs.13,00,000/- was paid to him by\n\nhis late father in his lifetimes for the plaintiff to purchase his house in\n\nR.T.Nagar. All the family members having benefited equally, there are\n\nno suspicious circumstances surrounding the WILL of their late father\n\nas none of his family members have been disinherited in the said WILL\n\nor otherwise.\n\n\n59)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that their father did not\n\nchoose to bequeath any residential property to the plaintiff or to him\n\nsince he has already funded the plaintiff in sum of Rs.13,00,000/- for\n\nthe plaintiff to purchase his house in R.T.Nagar and by them he had\n\nalso purchased the house bearing No.173 in the year 1997 itself. Thus\n\ntwo of his three sons already had residential properties at the time their\n\nlate father made his WILL dated 01/07/2000. The defendant No.1\n\nalready had the Ground Floor bearing No.37 below the Schedule-I\n\nproperty having, as stated above, purchased the same in her own name\n\nand from her own funds. His younger brother defendant No.3 is\n\nunmarried and is now aged 40 years. He had an open heart surgery in\n\nAugust 1997 at young age and his father always had special affection\n                                      106\n                                                          O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                          C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nfor him owing to his ailment. In these circumstances, their father chose\n\nto bequeath the Schedule-I property residential property to defendant\n\nNo.3, after the lifetime of defendant No.1 who still has life interest in\n\nthe same. Their father had spent on the marriages of his two\n\ndaughters/defendants No.4 and 5 and given cash and jewelry to them at\n\nthat time. Thus he gave them the Schedule-2 property jointly. This\n\nclearly shows that their late father has provided for all his family\n\nmembers in substantial way and to the exclusion on none and it is only\n\nthe plaintiffs agreed to snatch more than his share that has motivated\n\nhim to file this suit falsely alleging that his late father died intestate.\n\n\n60)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that the allegation of the\n\nplaintiff that the registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 of their late father\n\nis concoction is nothing short of gross insult to the departed soul who,\n\nthrough testamentary distribution of his self acquired properties,\n\nequitably distributed the same to all his heirs in spirit of justice and fair\n\nplay. As regards some earlier minor domestic differences between their\n\nlate father and defendants No.1 and 3 and himself including criminal\n\ncomplaint filed by their late father against the defendant No.3 and\n                                    107\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhimself at the instigation of the plaintiff, these were settled long prior\n\nto the execution of the said WILL, and the said complaint ended in 'B'\n\nFinal Report with nothing further since their late father on coming to\n\nknow of the true and correct facts brought the same to the notice of the\n\npolice himself. Thus in the face of the genuine and voluntary\n\ndisposition of all his immovable and movable properties by their late\n\nfather and his WILL having come into force after the date of his death\n\non 18/11/2000 the present suit seeking partition of his properties and\n\nassets is not maintainable and the suit is liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n61)      The DW.1 further deposed evidence that his mother/ defendant\n\nNo.1 is entitle to seek the ejectment of plaintiff from the Schedule-I\n\nproperty and also to claim damages from the plaintiff for his unlawful\n\nuse and occupation of the Schedule-I property from 18/11/2000, on\n\nwhich date she acquired her right and interest in the Schedule-I\n\nproperty through her late husband's WILL dated 01/07/2000 till date of\n\nthis suit and thereafter. His mother is entitle to claim sum of\n\nRs.2,28,000/- by way of damages or mesne profits from the plaintiff\n\nfrom 18/11/2000 till the date of this suit, i.e., for period of 19 months at\n                                    108\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe rate of Rs.12,000/- per month as the Schedule-I property is nearly\n\n1,300 square feet in extent, and even if let out at modest rate of about\n\nRs.9% per square foot the minimum monthly rent from the Schedule-I\n\nproperty will be nearly Rs.12,000/- per month. Besides this defendant\n\nNo.1 is also entitle to seek an enquiry into mesne profits from the date\n\nof this suit onwards. The DW.1 further deposed evidence that defendant\n\nNo.1, besides seeking dismissal of this suit on the ground that all the\n\nplaint Schedule Properties of the late Sampath Singh Bohra which were\n\nhis self-acquired properties, except the Schedule-VI property, have\n\nbeen validly bequeathed to his heirs, including to the plaintiff by their\n\nlate father's registered WILL dated 01/07/2000 and that nothing\n\nremained to be partitioned after his death and as on the date of filing of\n\nthis suit, is also entitle to make the counter-claim that she has made in\n\nher written statement. The DW.1 prays to dismiss suit of plaintiff and\n\ndecree the counter claim of defendant No.1 in this suit and decree the\n\nclaim in the clubbed suit OS.No.15743/2001 filed by defendant No.1\n\nfor mandatory injunction directing the plaintiff herein to cease using\n\nand occupying the plaint Schedule 1 property and to permit it use and\n                                   109\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\noccupation by defendant No.1 and directing the plaintiff herein to pay\n\ndefendant No.1 herein damages in a sum of Rs.2,28,000/- for\n\nunlawfully using and occupying the plaint Schedule property for the\n\nperiod 18/11/2000 to 17/06/2002 at the rate of Rs.12,000/- per month,\n\nand an enquiry into future mesne profits in respect of the plaint\n\nSchedule 1 property from the date of this suit onwards and prays to\n\ndecree counter claim for mandatory injunction directing defendant\n\nNo.6 to give effect to the nomination in respect of the plaint Schedule-4\n\nproperty bearing the deposits half by defendant No.6 under certificate\n\nof deposit originally bearing No.150254289 dated 29/08/2000 for\n\nRs,7,00,000/- maturing on 29/11/2000 and Certificate of deposit\n\noriginally bearing No.150254293 dated 09/09/2000 for Rs.8,00,000/-\n\nmaturing on 11/12/2000, and to pay the same to defendant No.1 who is\n\nnominee and legatee thereof and awarding costs of counter claim to\n\ndefendant No.1.\n\n\n62)     The DW.1 filed his affidavit in lieu of examination in chief as\n\nadditional evidence and deposed evidence that he sought permission of\n\ncourt to produce 4 documents annexed to the application dated\n                                   110\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n26/02/2019 by filing IA No.27 and the same has been allowed on\n\n26/02/2019 itself. The 1st document is photocopy of the original\n\nregistered lease cum sale agreement entered into by his father late\n\nSampath Singh with the lessor society by name \"The Ideal Homes Co-\n\noperative Building Society Ltd.\", which has been duly notarized. He is\n\nnot in a position to produce the original of the aforesaid document No.1\n\nin as much as the same has been very much available with the aforesaid\n\nsociety. However the duly notarized version of the said document\n\nproduced by me as document No.1 along with IA No.27 was the one\n\nmade available to me by the said society in token the original of the\n\nsaid document being available with them. There is no basis in the\n\ncontention sought to be raised by the plaintiff that the said document\n\ncannot be marked.\n\n\n63)    The DW.1 further deposed evidence that even otherwise it is an\n\nadmitted fact that the plaintiff himself relies upon the said document\n\nand included the property covered under the lease cum sale agreement\n\nin schedule 2 of the plaint. Further it is not in dispute that the said\n\ndocument is registered document on the file of the Sub-Registrar,\n                                   111\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nBommanahalli, registered as document No.4153/77-78 and he has\n\nalready made available the said document as document No.2 in IA\n\nNo.27. That even though there is no dispute about execution of said\n\ndocument by the plaintiff himself, he is relying upon the notarized\n\nphotocopy of the original document available with the lessor society.\n\nFrom the said document it is clear that his father had signed the said\n\ndocument as \"Sampath Singh\" and not as \"S S Bohra\" as sought to be\n\ncontended by the plaintiff. That in support of aforesaid contention that\n\nhis father used to sign on registered documents as \"S S Bohra\" as well\n\nas \"Sampath Singh\". The DW.1 further deposed evidence that under the\n\ncircumstances started above there is no impediment to mark the\n\nnotarized document as per document No.1 and the signature of my\n\nfather contained therein. That similarly the documents 2 to 4 being the\n\ncertified copies of the public documents and are relevant to deny the\n\nfalse contentions raised by the plaintiff it has become necessary for him\n\nto produce and mark in his evidence.\n\n\n64)     The defendant No.2/DW.1 filed another affidavit in lieu of\n\nexamination in chief as additional evidence and deposed evidence that\n                                   112\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nhe is son and Power of Attorney Holder of defendant No.1 i.e. ExD5\n\nsince his mother is aged and unwell and unable to personally give\n\nevidence in the above case. The contentions raised by the plaintiff by\n\nway of amendment and introduction of additional facts are false,\n\nfrivolous and vexatious to the knowledge of the plaintiff. That the\n\nplaintiff has raised the said contentions as an afterthought and there is\n\nabsolutely no bonafides much less the same are tenable in law. He\n\nemphatically denied the contention of the plaintiff that properties\n\ndescribed in Schedule 1-A and Schedule 1-B of the plaint were\n\npurchased by the father of the plaintiff in name of defendant No.1. In\n\nfact his mother/defendant No.1 became the exclusive and absolute\n\nowner in possession of the said properties on the strength of the\n\nregistered sale deeds and rectification deed executed in her name from\n\nout of her own individual income earned by her in her automobile\n\nbusiness and certainly not from out of the funds alleged to have been\n\nprovided by her husband i.e., father of himself and plaintiff. In fact\n\ndefendant No.1 has been Income Tax and Wealth Tax assessee in her\n\nindividual capacity for the last 39 years and the aforesaid registered\n                                   113\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndeeds in respect of the above said properties speak in volumes to the\n\nfact that both the properties are indisputably the self acquisition of\n\ndefendant No.1. Under the circumstances there is absolutely no basis in\n\nthe contention of the plaintiff that the consideration for both the\n\nproperties were paid by his father and that defendant No.1 could not\n\ndeal with the said properties on her own in any manner and the said\n\ncontentions are false. The defendant No.1 being absolute owner in\n\npossession of plaint schedule-1A property has gifted the same in favour\n\nof defendant No.3 under registered Gift Deed on 23/01/2007.\n\n\n65)       The DW.1 further deposed evidence that he denied the\n\ncontention of the plaintiff that the property described in schedule-3A of\n\nthe plaint has been purchased by late Sampath Singh in his name\n\nnominally and that the entire consideration for the same has been paid\n\nby him/plaintiffs father. That the aforesaid property has been acquired\n\nby him out of his own individual income earned by him in my\n\nindividual business of automobile finance and become the absolute\n\nowner in possession of the same on the strength of registered sale deed\n\ndated 25/01/1997. That it is undisputed fact that he is income tax\n                                     114\n                                                         O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                         C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nassessee for the last 23 years and he acquired the aforesaid property\n\ncomprised in schedule-3A of the plaint out of his own income. The\n\nplaintiff has no iota of material to show that the said property has been\n\npurchased in his name by his father nominally and as such there is no\n\nbasis in the contention that the plaintiff is entitle for share in the\n\nproperty. There is no basis in the imaginary plea of the plaintiff that the\n\njoint acquisition of the defendant No.1 and him with respect to\n\nschedule-3B of the plaint has been again financed by his father and the\n\nsaid contention is hereby false. That when defendant No.1 and him are\n\nincome tax assesses for the last several years having individual income\n\nof their own, there was no necessity whatsoever for them to seek\n\nfinance from their father and as such, it is only the figment of\n\nimagination of the plaintiff that he is entitle to 1/6 th share in said the\n\nplaint schedule-3B property and the said claim of the plaintiff is hereby\n\nfalse. That even otherwise said property has been sold by him in the\n\nyear 2002 to the knowledge of the plaintiff and the very fact that the\n\nplaintiff did not raise his little finger with respect to joint acquisition of\n\nthe same in the year 1995 by him and his mother disposed off the same\n                                   115\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nin the year 2002, would further speak in volumes to the fact that the\n\nclaim now sought to be put forward by the plaintiff with respect to the\n\nsaid property is an afterthought and obviously in order to harass and\n\ntease them. The plaintiff tries to approbate and reprobate in his\n\ncontentions regarding the very execution of the WILL. In one breath\n\nplaintiff contends that his father died intestate and that he did not\n\nexecute WILL relied upon by them and in another breath for the sake of\n\ntaking undue advantage of the situation the plaintiff claims 1/6 th share\n\nin the compensation amount alleged to have been received by me from\n\nthe owner of the premises bearing No.100, Subedhar Chatram Road,\n\nBangalore-560020.\n\n\n66)   The DW.1 further deposed evidence that the very dual contention\n\nof the plaintiff in this regard WILL lend support to the authenticity,\n\ngenuineness, truthfulness and execution of WILL relief upon by us in\n\nhis written statement. He denied the allegation of plaintiff that he has\n\nreceived any compensation from the owner of the aforesaid premises\n\nmuch less sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as contended by the plaintiff. In fact\n\npursuant to the terms of WILL, he alone was treated as a tenant of the\n                                    116\n                                                       O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                       C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\naforesaid premises by the owner of the said premises by receiving the\n\nmonthly rental of Rs.60/- per month and since the premises in question\n\nwas not useful to him, he was constrained to surrender the same in\n\nfavour of his landlord who instituted suit OS.No.6971/2005 for\n\neviction of the premises as against him alone and for consequential\n\nrelief of mesne profit at the rate of Rs.1,500/- p.m. The DW.1 further\n\ndeposed evidence that under the circumstances stated above claim of\n\nthe plaintiff to an extent of his alleged 1/6 th share being Rs.1,66,666/-\n\ntogether with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. is false, frivolous and most\n\nspeculative in nature. The DW.1 prays to dismiss the suit of plaintiff\n\nwith exemplary costs.\n\n\n67)     The defendant No.2 in O.S.No.2731/2002 examined the witness\n\nN.P. Ganapathy S/o Poovaiah as DW.2, he filed his affidavit in lieu of\n\nexamination in chief on 01/04/2017 and deposed evidence that he know\n\nSampath Singh Bohra since about 1978. The said Sampath Singh Bohra\n\nexecuted WILL on 01/07/2000 before Sub-Registrar, Gandhinagar,\n\nBangalore. He learnt that the said WILL was drafted by an advocate N.\n\nJayaprakash Roa in terms of the instructions of Sampath Singh Bohra.\n                                   117\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nAs per the request of the Sampath Singh Bohra he offered to act as one\n\nof the attesting witness to the said WILL and in that connection, he had\n\nattended the Sub-Registrar Office, Gandhinagar, Bangalore on\n\n01/07/2000 along with his brother N.P.Subbaiah who also offered\n\nhimself to act as one of the attesting witness to the WILL proposed to\n\nbe executed by the said Sampath Singh Bohra. He is well acquainted\n\nwith the signature of the executant of the said WILL. The said Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra at the time of execution of WILL was in sound disposition\n\nof mind and was able to understand the contents of the WILL and has\n\nsigned and executed the WILL on 01/07/2000 at the office of Sub-\n\nRegistrar Gandhinagar, Bangalore in his presence and he had seen the\n\nsaid executant Sampath Singh Bohra affixing his signature on the said\n\nWILL registered before the Sub-Registrar, Gandhinagar, Bangalore.\n\nThat even his brother as one of the attesting witness to the said WILL\n\nhas also seen the said executant affixing his signature in his presence.\n\nThe DW2 in his further examination in chief identified ExD4 registered\n\nWILL, ExD4(a) is his signature on the WILL and also 23 signatures as\n\nsignatures of Sampath Singh Bohra and said signatures are marked as\n                                   118\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nExD4(b) to ExD4(x). The plaintiff counsel got marked complaint copy\n\nat ExP124 and ExP125 through confrontation to this witness.\n\n\n68)    The defendant No.2 in OS.No.2731/2002 examined witness N.\n\nJayaprakash Rao S/o late L.Krishnojirao, Advocate as DW.3. That\n\nexamination in chief evidence of DW.3 was recorded by this court on\n\n04/07/2017. The DW.3 deposed evidence in his examination in chief\n\nthat he is practicing advocate since 1980. He has drafted ExD4 WILL\n\non 01/07/2000. After drafting the WILL ExD4 he went to Sub-Registrar\n\nOffice and got it registered. One Sampath Singh the testator of the\n\nWILL came to him and discussed with him about his intention to\n\nexecute WILL, accordingly he drafted the WILL as per the instructions\n\nof Sampath Singh and got it registered. He can identify the signature of\n\nthe testator found on ExD4. He had subscribed his signature as scribe\n\nto ExD4.\n\n\n69)        The plaintiff of OS.No.15743/2001 Surekhadevi is defendant\n\nNo.1 in OS.No.2731/2002. The said plaintiff in OS.No.16743/2001\n\nSurekhadevi has to prove the plaint allegations that she is the only\n                                  119\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nnominee for the deposits of amount of Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/-\n\nkept in the defendant No.1 Bank by her husband and she alone is entitle\n\nto receive the said amount as prayed in the plaint.

But what is significant and to\n          be noted is that one attesting witness examined\n          should be in a position to prove the execution of a\n          will to put in other words, if one attesting witness\n          can prove execution of the will in terms of Clause\n          (c) of Section 63, viz., attestation by two attesting\n          witnesses in the manner contemplated therein, the\n          examination of other attesting witness can be\n          dispensed with.       The one attesting witness\n          examined, in his evidence has to satisfy the\n          attestation of a will by him and the other attesting\n          witness in order to prove there was due execution\n          of the will. If the attesting witness examined\n          besides his attestation does not in his evidence,\n          satisfy the requirements of attention of the will by\n          other witness also it falls short of attestation of\n          will at least by two witnesses for the simple reason\n          that the execution of the will does not merely\n          mean the signing of it by the testator but it means\n          fulfilling and proof of all the formalities required\n                                  140\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n          under\nsection 63\nof the Succession Act. Where one\n          attesting witness examined to prove will under\nsection 68\nof the Evidence Act fails to prove the\n          due execution of the will then the other available\n          attesting witness has to be called to supplement his\n          evidence to make it complete in all respect. Where\n          one attesting witness is examined and he fails to\n          prove the attestation of the will by the other\n          witness there will be deficiency in meeting the\n          mandatory requirements of section 68 of the\n          evidence Act.\"\n                   (2013) 8 SCR 173\n       M.B.

Therefore the ExP125 is \"B\" extract of Car\n\nNo.CAB 6686 transferred in the name of N.P. Mani S/o N.T.

But to prove said fact that he is called by both\n\nname Mani @ Ganapathi he has not produced any other documentary\n\nevidence. Further the wife of DW.2 is running a P.G. in the building\n                                   159\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nbelonging to defendant No.2 Lokesh Singh on rental basis. This goes to\n\nshow that he is well acquaintance with defendant No.2. Further on\n\nExD4 WILL another witness N.P.Subbaiah was signed but the said\n\nwitness is not examined by the defendants No.1 to 3 of OS.2731/2002\n\nbecause DW.2 evidence discloses that he is interested witness. Further\n\nas per contention of defendants No.1 to 3 in OS.No.2731/2002\n\nSampath Singh Bohra executed ExD4 WILL on 01/07/2000. The\n\nplaintiff of said suit in OS.No.2731/2002 Dinesh Singh denied the\n\nexecution of said WILL by Sampath Singh Bohra as per plaintiff\n\nDinesh Singh on 01/07/2000 his father Sampath Singh Bohra was\n\nattended the funeral function of their relative Champalal. In the cross-\n\nexamination of DW.2 ExP111 Rajasthan Newspaper was confronted\n\nstating that regarding death of published said Champalal in the said\n\nnewspaper. But DW.2 deposed that he do not know who is Champalal.\n\nThe ExP110 is Rajasthan Newspaper dated 03/07/2000 wherein there is\n\npublication about death of Champalalji Bantiya and ExP111 is\n\ntranslation copy of Ex.P10.\n                                  160\n                                                    O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                    C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n98)     Further the ExD4 WILL discloses that it was prepared on\n\n01/07/2000, as there is averment in the last page that the witnesses\n\nNo.1 and 2 Ganapathi and Subbaiah have signed by putting date as\n\n01/07/2000, but in the said WILL on back side of the first page of said\n\nWILL, there is signature of Sub-Registrar and said WILL was\n\nregistered on 26/07/2000.    The ExP112 Hindi Newspaper Pathrika\n\ndated 20/11/2000 of Bangalore edition wherein there is publication that\n\nSampath Singh Bohra died on 18/11/2000 and ExP113 is Uttavana\n\nceremony regarding death of Sampath Singh Bohra. Further death of\n\nSampath Singh Bohra is admitted by plaintiff and defendants No.1 to 5\n\nin OS.No.2731/2002. But the defendant No.2 is examined as DW.1 and\n\nattesting witness Ganapathi examined as DW.2 in their evidence not\n\ndeposed that why there is delay of registration of the WILL on\n\n26/07/2000 because as per the said DW.1 and DW.2 Sampath Singh\n\nBohra executed the said WILL ExD4 on 01/07/2000. But there is delay\n\nof 25 days in registering the said WILL, hence the said delay is not\n\nproperly explained. Further on this aspect the plaintiff counsel cross-\n\nexamined DW.2 and he deposed the evidence that \"ದನವಹಕ 26/07/2000\n                                   161\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nರಹದಸ ನವನಸ ಸಬನ‍ ರಜಸವಕರನ ಕಛಹನರಗಹ ಹಹಕನಗಲಲ ಎಹದರಹ ಸವಕಕಗಹ ನವನಸ ಹಹಕನಗಲಲ ಏಕಹಹದರಹ\n\nಅವಶ‍ಯಕತಹ ಇರಲಲಲ ಅಹತ ಹಹನಳಸತಹನನಹ\". Further the DW.3 N. Jayaprakash Rao,\n\nAdvocate, as per the said DW.3 he drafted ExD4 WILL and in the said\n\nExD4, DW.3 also signed as drafted by him. But he has not put the date\n\ni.e. on which date he signed on the said WILL as scribe. In the cross-\n\nexamination of DW.3 by plaintiff counsel, the said witness denied the\n\nsuggestion that \"It is false to suggest that I had not gone to Sub-\n\nRegistrar's office. The signature of the witness was identified by one\n\nN.P. Subbaiah who is my client\". Therefore as per the DW.3 attesting\n\nwitness of the WILL N.P. Subbaiah is his client. But the said material\n\nwitness is not examined by the defendants of O.S.No.2731/2002.\n\nFurther DW.3 also not clarified why there is delay in registration of\n\nWILL on 26/07/2000 even though he has drafted the WILL on\n\n01/07/2000. These are the grounds creates doubt regarding the\n\ngenuineness of the WILL. The plaintiff Dinesh Singh denying\n\nexecution of ExD4 WILL by his father Sampath Singh Bohra. Under\n\nthe circumstances the heavy burden lies upon the defendants No.1 to 3\n\nof OS.No.2731/2002 to prove said WILL and also signatures on said\n                                   162\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nWILL are of Sampath Singh Bohra, because the plaintiff denied the\n\nsignatures ExD4 (b) to ExD4 (x) are not the signatures of Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra and his father used to sign as S.S. Bohra. The said plaintiff\n\nDinesh Singh marked ExP114 registered lease deed said to have been\n\nexecuted by Sampath Singh Bohra by signing as S.S.Bohra. In the said\n\nExP114 the signatures S.S.Bohra marked as ExP114(a) to ExP114(e)\n\ncontending that the said signatures are all Sampath Singh Bohra.\n\n\n99)   That as per plaintiff Dinesh Singh signatures in the ExP114 are\n\nall his father. Whereas the DW.1 marked ExD179 lease cum sale\n\nagreement wherein Sampath Singh Bohra lease cum sale agreement\n\nwherein Sampath Singh Bohra signed as Sampath Singh Bohra. That\n\nin ExD4 signatures all marked as ExD4 (b) to ExD4(x) stating that they\n\nbelong to Sampath Singh Bohra and he signed in the said document.\n\nBut on perusal of the signature from ExD4(b) to ExD4(x) there are\n\nslight variation in the said signatures. Further the plaintiff has marked\n\nExP6 complaint filed by Sampath Singh Bohra before Station Officer\n\nOfficer, High Grounds Police Station, Bengaluru stating that in the said\n\nExP6 Sampath singh signed. The said document is not denied by\n                                   163\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3. As discussed above ExP114, ExP6, ExD179 and\n\nExD4 are on record, it is contended by plaintiff and defendant No.2\n\nthat in all these documents Sampath Singh Bohra signed, but to prove\n\nthe signatures of Sampath Singh Bohra in ExD4 marked as ExD4(b) to\n\nExD4(x) in comparison with the admitted signature of said Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra, the defendants No.1 to 3 have not made any effort to refer\n\nthe said document to the hand writing expert for comparison of the\n\ndisputed signature of Sampath Singh Bohra with admitted signatures.\n\nTherefore prima facie the defendants No.1 to 5 of OS.No.2731/2002\n\nare failed to prove the WILL/ExD4. The citations referred by the\n\nplaintiff counsel in OS.No.2731/2002 relating to WILL as discusses\n\nabove applies to this case in hand, since the genuineness of the WILL\n\nand execution of WILL/ExD4 by Sampath Singh Bohra is not proved\n\nby the defendants No.1 to 3 in the said suit and citations referred by\n\nsaid defendants No.1 to 3 does not applies their defence.\n\n\n100)    The plaintiff contended that his father owned ancestral house\n\nproperty situated at Bilara village, Jodhpur district, Rajasthan state\n\nmeasuring approximately 1200 sq. constructed house i.e. plaint\n                                  164\n                                                   O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                   C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nschedule-6 property.

That relating to suit\n\nschedule item No.5 (iv) 4 Diamond Bangles ii) Cash on hand\n\nRs.50,710/- the plaintiff Dinesh Singh has not produced any\n\ndocuments.

Deposit\n\nNo.150254289 of Rs.7,00,000/- 2. Deposit No.150254293 of\n\nRs.8,00,000/-. Under the circumstances Sampath Singh Bohra\n\nspecifically nominated for receiving the said matured Fixed Deposits\n\namount by his wife Surekhadevi. Under the circumstances the children\n\nof Sampath Singh Bohra and Surekha Devi i.e. plaintiff and defendants\n\nNo.2 to 5 in OS.No.2731/2002 are not entitle for any share in the said\n\nFixed Deposit amount of Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- and plaintiff\n\nof     OS.No.15743/2001   (defendant   No.1    of   OS.No.2731/2002)\n\nSurekhadevi alone is entitle to receive the entire Fixed Deposit amount\n\nof Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- with accrued interest on the said\n\nFixed Amount on the date of receipt.\n\n\n104)      That the plaintiff Dinesh Singh in OS.No.2731/2002 claimed\n\nshare in Schedule-7, which is mentioned that \"Sampath Singh Bohra\n                                   174\n                                                      O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nwas tenant of shop premises bearing No.100, Subedar Chatram Road,\n\nBengaluru and the defendant No.2 has handed over this premises to the\n\nowner after receiving Rs.10,00,000/- compensation from the owner and\n\nplaintiff is claiming Rs.1,66,666/- being 1/4th share together with\n\ninterest at the rate of 18% p.m. from the defendant No.2\". That relating\n\nto schedule-7 property, the plaintiff of OS.No.2731/2002 has not\n\nproduced any documents and marked in this case to prove that he is\n\nhaving 1/4 share in Rs.10,00,000/- received by defendant No.2 as a\n\ncompensation from the owner of the property bearing No.100, Subedar\n\nChatram Road, Bengaluru. Therefore the plaintiff of OS.No.2731/2002\n\nDinesh Singh is not entitle for share in schedule Items No.4 and 7 of\n\nOS.No.2731/2002.\n\n\n105)      That plaintiff of OS.No.15743/2001 Surekhadevi has not\n\nexamined the said suit. But after clubbing of OS.No.2731/2002 in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001, the defendant No.2 in OS.No.2731/2002 Lokesh\n\nSingh   commonly     examined     as    DW.1   and    the   plaintiff   of\n\nOS.No.15743/201 is the defendant No.1 in OS.No.2731/2002 and in\n\nthe said OS.No.2731/2002 the defendant No.2 Lokesh Singh has also\n                                 175\n                                                   O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                   C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndeposed the evidence as GPA holder of defendant No.1 as discussed\n\nabove and he deposed about the said Fixed Deposits of Rs.7,00,000/-\n\nand Rs.8,00,000/- as contended in said OS.No.15743/2001. As\n\ndiscussed above Surekhadevi who is the wife of late Sampath Singh\n\nBohra is nominee of the Fixed Deposits of Rs.7,00,000/- and\n\nRs.8,00,000/- kept in defendant No.1 Global Trust Bank Ltd., in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001 and she is only entitle to receive the Fixed Deposit\n\namount with accrued interest, hence it is just and proper to issue\n\ndirection to the defendant No.1 Global Trust Bank Ltd., in\n\nOS.No.15743/2001     for   release    the   matured   Fixed   Deposit\n\nNos.15024289 amounting to Rs.7,00,000/- and F.D.No.150254293\n\namounting to Rs.8,00,000/- in the name of Sampath Singh Bohra to his\n\nwife Surekadevi.\n\n\n106)   Further in OS.No.2731/2002 Additional Issue No.1 was framed\n\non 13/10/2010 that whether the property bearing No.45, 8 th Cross,\n\nHMT Layout, Vishweshwaraiah Nagar, Gangenahalli Bengaluru is\n\nliable for partition as contended the by defendants No.1 to 3. The\n\nExD44 is produced and marked by DW.2. The ExD44 is certified copy\n                                   176\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nof sale deed dated 08/12/01995 regarding purchase of property bearing\n\nNo.45, HMT Layout, 7th Cross, Vishweshwaraiah Naar, Gangenahalli,\n\nBengaluru by Mala Bohra W/o Dinesh Singh from Ramarao S/o\n\nSubbarao. The defendants No.1 to 3 in the written statement filed on\n\n11/06/2002 and also filed additional Written Statement by defendant\n\nNo.2 filed on 22/07/2009, wherein there is no prayer claiming share in\n\nthe said property. Further defendants No.1 to 3 in OS.No.2731/2002\n\nprays to dismiss the suit of the plaintiff with costs and that decree of\n\nmandatory injunction be passed in favour of defendant No.1 and\n\nagainst plaintiff directing the plaintiff to cease using and occupying\n\nplaint schedule-I first floor including 2 rooms (without garage which is\n\nin the occupation of defendant No.1) and furnish with occupation by\n\nthe defendant No.1 and decree some of Rs.2,38,000/- in favour of\n\ndefendant No.1 against the plaintiff by way of damages/mesne profits\n\nfrom 19/11/2000 till date and further direct enquiry into future mesne\n\nprofits. But there is no counter claim relating to the property bearing\n\ncorporaton No.45, 8th cross, HMT Layout, Vishweshwraiahnagar,\n\nGangenahalli, Bengaluru in the written statement filed by the\n                                     177\n                                                         O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                         C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 by way of counter claim. Therefore the said\n\nproperty is not liable for partition in the said property, since no relief is\n\nclaimed in the written statement by the defendants No.1 to 3, hence the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 are not entitle for relief relating to said property\n\nand defendants No.1 to 3 failed to prove Additional Issue No.1.\n\nTherefore the plaintiff in O.S.No.15743/2001 is entitle for the relief of\n\nmandatory injunction against the defendant No.1 as prayed in view of\n\ndiscussion made above the plaintiff in OS.15743/2001 proved Issues\n\nNo.1 and 2 in the said suit. Further the plaintiff in OS.No.2731/2002\n\npartly proved Issues No.1 to 3. Since the plaintiff is joint family\n\nmember as of the defendants No.1 to 3, hence he is not entitle for\n\nmesne profits. Hence plaintiff in OS.2731/2002 failed to prove Issue\n\nNo.4. Further the plaintiff has failed to prove by way of documentary\n\nevidence that he is entitle for 1/4th share in the capital amount of Joint\n\nHindu Undivided family, hence failed to prove Issue No.5. Further\n\nfrom oral and documentary evidence as discussed above it is clear that\n\nthere is no partition taken place in the family of Sampath Singh Bohra\n\nwith his children, hence plaintiff Dinesh Singh in OS.No.2731/2002\n                                    178\n                                                        O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                        C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nproved by way of documentary evidence that he is entitle for 1/6th\n\nshare in suit schedule-1, Schedule-1A, Schedule-1B, Schedule-3,\n\nSchedule-3A and failed to prove by way of documentary evidence that\n\nschedule-2, schedule-5, schedule-6, schedule-7 properties are          joint\n\nfamily properties and he is entitle for share in the said properties.\n\nFurther it is admitted fact that plaintiff is in possession of suit schedule\n\nNo.1 who has hold the said property as joint family property. Hence\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 are not entitled for mandatory injunction to get\n\nthe said property from plaintiff. Hence defendants No.1 to 3 in\n\nOS.No.2731/2002 failed to prove Issues No.6 and 7. Further the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 failed to prove that the suit is bad for mis-joinder\n\nof necessary parties, hence failed to prove Issue No.8. Further the\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 in OS.No.2731/2002 failed to prove that Sampath\n\nSingh Bohra executed WILL on 01/07/2000 bequeathing the properties\n\nand hence defendants No.1 to 3 failed to prove Issue No.9. Further the\n\nplaintiff in OS.No.2731/2002 proved that the suit schedule-3A property\n\nis joint family property as discussed above, and Schedule-3B property\n\nwas already deleted from the suit as per order dated 04/07/2017. Hence\n                                   179\n                                                     O.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                     C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\nthe plaintiff is entitle for 1/6th share in Schedule-3A property and\n\nplaintiff proved Additional Issue No.2 partly. That the suit schedule-3B\n\nproperty and defendants No.7 are already deleted from the suit in\n\nOS.No.2731/2002 on 04/07/2017. Hence giving findings on Additional\n\nIssues No.3 and 4 does not arise. Further the plaintiff has failed to\n\nprove by way of documentary evidence that he is entitle for 1/6 th share\n\nin schedule item No.7 by way of documentary evidence and hence\n\nfailed to prove Additional Issue No.5. Therefore I answer Issues No.1\n\nand 2 in OS.No.15743/2001 in Affirmative. Further I answer Issues\n\nNo.1 to 3 in OS.No.2731/2002 partly in Affirmative. Further I answer\n\nIssues No.4 to 9 and Additional Issue No.1 and Additional Issue\n\nNo.5 in OS.No.2731/2002 in Negative. Further I answer Additional\n\nIssue No.2 in OS.No.2731/2002 partly in Affirmative.\n\n\n107)    Issue No.3 in OS.No.15743/2001 and Issue No.10 in\n\nOS.No.2731/2002:\n\n\n       In view of above discussion I proceed to pass the following\n\n\n                          :ORDER:\n180\nO.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                      C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n          The suit of the plaintiff in OS.No.15743/2001 is\n\n     decreed with costs.\nIt is ordered and decreed that the defendant\n\n     No.1 Bank is directed to release and pay deposits\n\n     amount       kept    in   deposit     No.150254289   of\n\n     Rs.7,00,000/-       and   deposit     No.150254293   of\n\n     Rs.8,00,000/- by late Sampath Singh Bohra to\n\n     plaintiff Surekhadevi nominee of said Sampath\n\n     Singh with accrued interest up to date of payment.\nDraw decree accordingly.\nThe suit of the plaintiff in OS.No.2731/2002\n\n     is partly decreed with costs.\nIt is ordered and partly decreed the suit of\n\n     plaintiff Dinesh Singh in OS.No.2731/2002 for\n\n     partition and separate possession and he is entitle for\n\n     1/6th share in the properties schedule-I, schedule-1A,\n181\nO.S.No.15743/2001\nCommon Judgment                                                                  C /w O.S.No.2731/2002\n\n     schedule-1B, schedule-3A.

It resulted in registration of\ncase FIR No. RC.22(A)/92.\n1.1           Registration of said FIR also led to the search of house of\naccused Ram Singh. Such search brought to fore various incriminating\ndocuments pertaining to numerous transactions done by accused Ram Singh\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                        Page 1 of 145\nand his wife accused Savitri Singh.\n1.2           Accordingly, two additional but separate FIRs were registered\nagainst accused Ram Singh and his wife Savitri Singh for being found in\npossession of assets disproportionate to their respective income.      These\nwere RC N. 26 (A)/92-ACB dated 24.04.1992 against Ram Singh and RC No.\n44 (A)/92-ACB dated 13.07.1992 against Savitri Singh.\n1.3           At the relevant time, Ram Singh, an IAS officer, was working as\nGeneral Manager, Delhi Milk Scheme (DMS) and his wife Smt. Savitri Singh\nwas working as Inspector, Income Tax.\n1.4           As per investigating agency, the financial background of Sh.\nRam Singh was very ordinary as his father Sh. Pehlu Singh and his mother\nRamkali had no substantial income to acquire any property. During 1970,\nRam Singh and his brothers had mere 1.16 acres of land at their native place\nwhich they owned jointly. In 1976, 0.089 hectares of barren land was allotted\nto them on lease by the government. Neither accused Ram Singh nor his\nbrothers purchased/acquired any land in their village till 1989 which also\nindicated their weak financial condition.\n1.5           Ram Singh had two brothers namely Sh. Ram Avatar Singh and\nSh. Ashok Kumar Singh and two sisters namely Smt. Sukhdevi and Smt.\nKusumlata Das.\n1.6           Sh. Ram Avatar Singh was working in M.P. Forest Corporation\nwhile Ashok Kumar Singh, a student at the relevant time, was doing\ninternship in Medical College at Jabalpur. Sh. Ram Avatar Singh as well as\nhis wife Smt. Raj Kumari Singh were residing in Bhopal and were in no\nposition to make any investment as their financial status was also not sound.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 2 of 145\n1.7          Sh. Ram Singh had earlier joined Labour Department in Simla\nbut eventually got selected as Civil Servant in the year 1972.\n1.8          Savitri Singh had joined Income Tax Department in the month\nof May, 1969. She got married to Ram Singh on 13.04.1971. They were\nblessed with three children, namely, Jitender Kumar Singh, Gaurav Kumar\nSingh and Miss Sangeeta Bala Singh.            All three of them, mostly, studied in\nDelhi and did their schooling from DPS, R.K. Puram. According to\ninvestigation, educational expenses of Ashok Kumar Singh, (younger brother\nof Ram Singh) were also borne by accused.\n1.9          As per investigation, most of the assets, movable and\nimmovable, were acquired by the accused from 1985 onwards and,\ntherefore, check period has been taken from 1.1.1985 to 13.4.1992.\n1.10         As per investigating agency, both the accused conspired with\neach other and started accumulating assets by dubious means and in a\nsurreptitious manner. Such acquisition was made by them either in their own\nnames or in the names of their children or close relatives. They both indulged\nin benami transactions and to hide such acquisition, they opened benami\nbank accounts and created false documents.\n1.11         Investigation revealed that they both had opened a large\nnumber of bank accounts, 66 in number to be precise, and all such accounts\nused to be operated by them. These accounts, which were either in their own\nnames or in the names of their children or in the names of other close\nrelatives, were managed by them only and they were responsible for the\ntransactions carried out in such accounts.\n1.12         Savitri Singh had opened bank accounts in different names viz\n'Savitri Devi' and 'Raj Kumari Singh' etc. She opened forged bank accounts\nand operated those as well.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                   Page 3 of 145\n1.13            Both the accused also got prepared false receipts in the name\nof Ms. Ram Kali (mother of accused Ram Singh) showing sale of jewellery.\nThese receipts were created for the purpose of fabricating false evidence to\nshow their enhanced income.\n1.14            Investigation      was       carried   out   and   details   of     Income,\nExpenditure and Assets were collected.\n1.15            Though separate FIRs had been registered and initially\ninvestigation was also separate, yet eventually CBI decided to file a\ncomposite charge sheet particularly keeping in mind the fact that both the\naccused were 'husband and wife' and were residing together and also\nbecause there was a clear-cut conspiracy between them.\n1.16            As per the final conclusion of investigating agency, both the\naccused were found in possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of\nRs. 53,23,408.00. Following chart would depict the same:-\n1.     Assets at the beginning of the check period i.e. 1.1.85                      4,35,073.00\n\n2      Income during check period                                                 15,25,839.00\n3.     Expenditure during check period                                              7,51,546.00\n4.     Likely savings (2-3)                                                         7,74,293.00\n5.     Assets acquired during check period                                        60,97.701.00\n6.     Assets at the close of check period i.e. on 13.4.92                        65,32,774.00\n7.     Total disproportion in assets (5-4)                                        53,23,408.00\n\n\n\n1.17            After obtaining sanction for their prosecution, such charge\nsheet was submitted before the court on 26.5.98.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                         Page 4 of 145\nCOGNIZANCE AND CHARGES\n\n\n2.0             Cognizance was taken by the court on 18.7.1998 and both the\naccused were directed to be summoned.\n2.1             Arguments on charge were heard and vide order dated\n25.9.2004, both the accused were directed to be charged for commission of\noffences under Sections 120-B read with\nSection 13(2)\nread with 13(1)(e) of\nP.

Both the accused pleaded\nnot guilty to such charges framed on 18.10.2004 and claimed trial.\n2.2             It will be also not out of place to mention here that both the\naccused were also directed to admit or deny the documents relied upon by\nthe prosecution and number of documents were admitted by accused Ram\nSingh as well as accused Savitri Singh as is evident from the order sheet\ndated 24.4.2004.\n2.3             Following documents were admitted by accused Savitri Singh:-\nS.

Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                            Page 17 of 145\n4.1           She contended that she had not entered into any benami\ntransaction and had no concern with the properties which were in the names\nof her relatives. She asserted that witnesses of prosecution had deposed\nfalsely under the influence or pressure of CBI.         She claimed that her\nhusband-accused Ram Singh had filed an appeal in Income Tax Department\nand said appeal was decided in favour of her husband holding that properties\nwhich were in the names of his relatives did not belong to him and the money\nfor purchasing those properties had not been given by Ram Singh to his\nrelatives. She also claimed that other owners of properties have already filed\ntheir claims/objections in the Court.\n4.2           She also examined seven witnesses, namely, DW1 Ashok\nKumar Singh (her devar/brother-in-law), DW2 Ram Prakash Singh (cousin of\nher husband Ram Singh), DW3 Dr. Sarita Punia (her younger sister), DW4\nMs. Raj Kumari Singh (her devrani/sister in law), DW5 Ram Avtar Singh (her\ndevar/brother-in-law), DW6 Kusum Lata (her nanad/sister-in-law) and DW-7\nJitender Singh (her son). She also chose to enter into witness box as DW8.\nRIVAL CONTENTIONS\n\n\n5.0           Sh. Rao, Ld. Sr. PP CBI has stated that accused persons had\nvery cleverly and cunningly diverted their ill-gotten money and made huge\ninvestment in benami names. They opened number of bank accounts in the\nnames of their relatives and acquaintances. Such ill-gotten money was\ndeposited and later on siphoned off from such accounts for acquiring\nimmovable assets. He contended that report of handwriting expert clearly\nnails down the complicity of accused Savitri Singh who had shown the\naudacity of signing in different names for the purpose of opening of bank\naccounts and investment.\n5.1           Sh. Rao has expressed his astonishment claiming that despite\nthe fact that she was a responsible government official, she did not think\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 18 of 145\ntwice or even blink before indulging into any such fraudulent activity. He has\nargued that since she knew that her such deceitful act might come to fore,\nshe did not deliberately give her specimen handwriting and signatures and,\ntherefore, adverse inference should be drawn against her. He has also\nargued that though separate FIRs were registered but since both the accused\npersons were living together and sharing the same household, it was thought\nthat a consolidated charge sheet would ensure that no prejudice is caused\nand, therefore, accused cannot claim any disadvantage or discrimination on\nsuch account.\n5.2           He has argued that the prosecution has been able to prove\ndisproportionate assets by examining number of witnesses and exhibition of\nseveral documents. He has also argued that when the lockers of the accused\nwere searched, these were found containing various property documents,\nFDRs, jewellery, IVPs etc. Since these were found to be in the exclusive\npossession of the accused, it has to be necessarily inferred that all such\narticles lying in the locker belonged to the accused and accused alone. Sh.\nRao has asserted that accused Savitri Devi has taken a false plea that many\nsuch jewellery articles, FDRs and IVPs belonged to her relatives. According\nto him, no such relative or acquaintance, living at a far off place, would permit\nall these things to be kept in locker of accused Savitri Devi in Delhi.\n5.3           Sh. Rao has also contended that all the objections filed by\nvarious objectors have no merit and are liable to be discarded and the\nattachment order needs to be made absolute.\n5.4           All such assertions have been rejected by the defence.\n5.5           According to Ld. defence counsel Sh. M. P. Singh, investigation\nwas unfair and biased. It has been argued that for the reasons best known to\nthe investigating agency, they never chose to make any enquiry from Ram\nKali or her husband Pehlu Singh. It has been argued that they both were\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 19 of 145\nhaving substantial income, agricultural & rental both, and were in a position\nto maintain themselves with dignity and also to invest in various properties.\n5.6            He has also contended that investigating agency has\nunjustifiably clubbed two separate FIRs which has caused immense\nprejudice to the defence. He has agitated that due to untimely demise of\naccused Ram Singh, Savitri Devi is feeling prejudiced to a very great extent\nas she is not able to offer satisfactory explanation about some of the alleged\nacquisition of properties which her husband was definitely in a better position\nto explain about.\n5.7            He has also argued that accused Savitri Devi never forged any\ndocument and never signed as someone else. He has argued that the report\nof Handwriting expert cannot be pressed into service which, even otherwise,\nis a very weak type of evidence and cannot be relied without sufficient\ncorroboration. He has also drawn my attention towards the testimony of\nvarious defence witnesses claiming that all such defence witnesses have\ndemolished the case of prosecution. He has contended that if the properties,\nwhich are otherwise acquired by such other relatives, are excluded, it would\nbecome absolutely clear that there were no disproportionate assets.\n5.8            During the course of arguments, Sh. M. P. Singh, Ld. defence\ncounsel, after taking instructions from the accused who was present during\nthe course of final arguments, reiterated about the admission of several\ndocuments by her. While pointing out several entries contained in various\nannexures, he admitted the following entries:-\nSl.

Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                           Page 21 of 145\nAPPRECIATION OF EVIDENCE\n\n\n6.0           Possession of disproportionate assets itself constitutes an of-\nfence of criminal misconduct. Essentially, such offence is based on the un-\nstated presumption that such assets must have been acquired by corrupt or\nillegal means or by abuse of official position. No further proof of mens rea is,\ntherefore, required to be established.\n6.1           Ingredients of the offence under\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof the 1988\nAct are as under:-\n(i) the accused is a public servant;\n(ii) the nature and extent of the pecuniary resources of property found in his\npossession;\n(iii) his known sources of income ;\n(iv) such resources or properties found in possession of the accused are\ndisproportionate to his known sources of income.\n6.2           Once the aforementioned ingredients are established by the\nprosecution, the burden of proof shifts on the accused to show that the\nprosecution case was not correct. Accused is required to satisfactorily\naccount for possession by him of assets disproportionate to his income. The\nextent and nature of burden of proof resting upon the public servant cannot\nbe higher than establishing his case by a preponderance of probability. But,\nat the same time, as rightly pointed out by Sh. Rao while relying on\nState of\nMP Vs. Awadh Kishore Gupta\n2004(1) SCC 691, legislature has advisedly\nused the expression \"satisfactorily account\" and has thus, deliberately cast a\nburden on the accused not only to offer a plausible explanation as to how he\ncame by his large wealth but also to satisfy the Court that his explanation was\nworthy of acceptance. Thus such burden has to be discharged in a\nsatisfactory manner as well.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 22 of 145\n6.3           Sh. M.P. Singh has vehemently asserted that the death of Ram\nSingh has left a big vacuum in the case thereby causing serious prejudice to\nhis surviving spouse, she being not in a position to explain several such\nassets acquired by him particularly when she is more than 70 years of age\nand confined to wheel chair.\n6.4           I am mindful of the fact that prime accused Ram Singh died\nduring the trial. In such type of matters, the explanation given by accused\ncarries immense importance. Of course, had Ram Singh been alive, he might\nhave offered explanation and clarification about some of the assets in\nsomewhat better manner. Viewed from that angle, the situation is indeed\ntricky as offence, normally, would stand proved when accused fails to offer\nany explanation. Therefore, ideal and prudence requirement would to\noffer every such accused a proper opportunity during the investigation\nstage itself instead of asking him to reveal his version before the court,\non being summoned. Soliciting explanation from him at the very\nthreshold would help investigating agency as well as the court to\ncomprehend as to for which properties or acquisition, he has any\ndisagreement. As far as possible, such final chart containing figures related\nto assets, income and expenditure should be properly served upon him\nduring the investigation stage itself and he should be clearly asked to\nrespond to all such entries in writing. This might also avert any possibility of\nhaving any grievance or prejudice from the side of accused. I can only expect\nthat investigating agency would keep such suggestion in mind in future while\nconducting investigation in such type of matters.\n6.5           Though, death of Ram Singh would not automatically imply that\na grave prejudice is caused to his surviving accused, I would deal with the\ndefence contentions bit more sympathetically and liberally while also ensuring\nthat no injustice is caused to CBI.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 23 of 145\nISSUE OF BENAMI PROPERTY AND BENAMI ACCOUNTS\n\n\n7.0               According to Ld. Prosecutor, accused persons had devised a\nnovel way and opened up multiple bank accounts in the names of their other\nrelatives. All such benami accounts were managed and controlled by none\nother than by accused persons and, in particularly, by accused Savitri Singh.\nHe has contended that the holder-on-record did not have even an inkling that\nany such account in his/her name had been opened. So much so, the\nsignatures on relevant bank-documents had been put by accused Savitri Devi\nherself.\n7.1               Let me deal with such alleged benami accounts and benami\nproperties. However, before that, let me also see the pedigree table of ac-\ncused persons. Same is as under:-\nPehlwan Singh\n                                    (Spouse- Ram kali)\n\n\n\n\n      Sukhdevi         Kusum Lata                      Ashok Singh\n      (Spouse-         (DW6)                           (DW1)         Ram Avtar\n      Ram Snehi        Spouse- Ram                                   DW5\n                       Das                                           (Spouse\n                                                                     DW4) Raj\n                                                                     Kumari)\n\n                              Ram Singh (Accused)\n                              Spouse- Savitri Singh\n                              (Accused)                               Ankita\n                                                                      Sweta\n                                                                      Rohit\n\n\n\n                                        Jitender@ Sandeep\n                                        DW7\n                                        Gaurav Singh\n                                        Sangeeta Bala Singh\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 24 of 145\n7.2          The alleged benami properties and accounts etc. were, as per\nCBI, taken in the names of Ram Kali, Raj Kumari Singh, Ashok Kumar Singh,\nRam Avtar Singh, Ram Prakash, Puttu Lal, Kusum Lata and children of Raj\nKumari Singh.\n7.3          According to defence, as already noted above, accused had no\nconnection with any such account or property in said names and those\npersons/relatives themselves had either opened up such accounts or bought\nproperty or made investment with their own money. It has been claimed that\nPehlu Singh had enough of means to take care of his children and he and\nRamkali had substantial income from agriculture as well as by creating\ntenancy. It has been reiterated that they were never examined by CBI during\ninvestigation to obtain a clear picture and before, they could be examined in\ndefence, they both left for their heavenly abode.\n7.4          Where a person buys a property with his own money but in the\nname of another person without any intention to benefit such other person,\nthe transaction is called benami. In that case, the transferee holds the\nproperty for the benefit of the person who has contributed the purchase\nmoney, and he is the real owner. Hon'ble Delhi High Court has, in the case\nof Krishna Kumar v. Harnamdas [1991] 56 Taxman 233 (Delhi), held that\nBenami transaction means any transaction in which the property is\ntransferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by another\nperson and that such transaction would stand attracted if (i) there is a\ntransfer of property, and (ii) the consideration is paid or provided not by the\ntransferee, but by another person.\n7.5          The burden of proof regarding benami is upon the one who\nalleges benami. Naturally, here, in the case in hand, such onus lies upon\nprosecution. Such aspect of benami transaction was considered by Hon'ble\nApex Court in\nValliammal (D) By Lrs vs Subramaniam & Ors\n(2004) 7 SCC\n233, wherein it was held as under:\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 25 of 145\n\"This Court in a number of judgments has held that it is well- established\n              that burden of proving that a particular sale is benami lies on the person\n              who alleges the transaction to be a benami. The essence of a benami\n              transaction is the intention of the party or parties concerned and often,\n              such intention is shrouded in a thick veil which cannot be easily pierced\n              through. But such difficulties do not relieve the person asserting the\n              transaction to be benami of any part of the serious onus that rests on\n              him, nor justify the acceptance of mere conjectures or surmises, as a\n              substitute for proof.\nReferred to Jaydayal Poddar Vs. Bibi Hazra\n, 1974 (1)\n              SCC 3;\nKrishnanand Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n, 1977 (1) SCC 816;\nThakur Bhim Singh Vs. Thakur Kan Singh\n, 1980 (3) SCC 72;\nHis\n              Highness Maharaja Pratap Singh Vs. Her Highness Maharani Sarojini\n              Devi & Ors.\n, 1994 (Supp.\n(1) SCC 734; and\nHeirs of Vrajlal J. Ganatra\n              Vs. Heirs of Parshottam S. Shah\n, 1996 (4) SCC 490. It has been held\n              that in the\njudgments\nreferred to above\nthat the question whether a\n              particular sale is a benami or not, is largely one of fact, and for\n              determining the question no absolute formulas or acid test, uniformly\n              applicable in all situations can be laid. After saying so, this Court spelt out\n              following six circumstances which can be taken as a guide to determine\n              the nature of the transaction:\n1. the source from which the purchase money came;\n2. the nature and possession of the property, after the purchase;\n3. motive, if any, for giving the transaction a benami colour;\n4. the position of the parties and the relationship, if any, between the\n              claimant and the alleged benamidar;\n5. the custody of the title deeds after the sale; and\n6. the conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the property after\n              the sale.\nThe above indicia are not exhaustive and their efficacy varies according\n              to the facts of each case. Nevertheless, the source from where the\n              purchase money came and the motive why the property was purchased\n              benami are by far the most important tests for determining whether the\n              sale standing in the name of one person, is in reality for the benefit of\n              another\"\n7.6           The Supreme Court in\nG. Mahalingppaa v. G. M. Savitha\n[2005] 147 Taxman 583 (SC) also observed that the following findings of\nfacts arrived at by the appellate court and the trial court would conclusively\nprove that the transaction in question was benami in nature: (i) the appellant\nhad paid the purchase money; (ii) the original title deed was with the\nappellant; (iii) the appellant had mortgaged the suit property for raising loan to\nimprove the same; (iv) he paid taxes for the suit property; (v) he had let out\nthe suit property and collecting rents from the tenants; (vi) the motive for\npurchasing the suit property in the name of plaintiff was that the plaintiff was\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                           Page 26 of 145\nborn on an auspicious nakshatra and the appellant believed that if the\nproperty was purchased in the name of plaintiff / respondent, the appellant\nwould prosper; and (vii) the circumstances surrounding the transaction,\nrelationship of the parties and subsequent conduct of the appellant.\n7.7           One can also be guided by the principles\nlaid down in\nJayadayal Poddar (Deceased) through\nLRs and Anr. v. Mst\n.\nBibi Hazra\n[1974] 2 SCR 90 and Bhim Singh v. Kan Singh AIR [1980] SC 727.\n7.8           Thus, all aforesaid factors are of immense importance to\ndetermine whether the transaction is benami or not. A combination of some\nor all of them and a proper weighing and appreciation of their value would\nobviously go a long way towards indicating whether the transaction was\nbenami or not. I would also remind myself that in every benami transaction,\nthe intention of the parties is the essence.\n7.9           I would now take up the aspect of such benami accounts and\nproperties.\nBank accounts opened in the name of Raj Kumari Singh\n\n\n8.0           As per details appearing in charge sheet in Annexure-IV(b),\nfollowing bank account had been opened in the name of Raj Kumari Singh:-\nSl.

I have\nseen her deposition very carefully and in her testimony, she made reference\nabout three vital things.\n8.3           Firstly, she claimed that she had purchased flat no. 4/2 Vaishali,\nGhaziabad in the year 1989 and that she had accordingly deposited Rs.\n31,000/- same year. She, however, specifically claimed that she had not\npurchased any other property in Noida nor had booked any property in Noida.\nSecondly, she made reference about her statement of account in Syndicate\nBank, R. K. Puram. According to her, it was her own account. She also made\nreference to specimen signature card (Ex. PW 33/A) and several related\ncheques claiming that such card and cheques were bearing her signatures.\nThirdly, she made mention about the 'Objection' which had been filed by her\nand her daughter Ankita. Surprisingly, as regards such Objection Petition\n(Ex. DW 4/9), she claimed that these objections were not filed by her. Though\nshe did claim that such objections were bearing her signature at point 'A' but\naccording to her, these were never filed by her and she never conveyed the\nfacts mentioned therein to anybody. She also claimed that she had one gold\nset and four bangles which she had kept with accused Savitri Singh as her\narea was not safe.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                  Page 28 of 145\n8.4          Evidently, in her deposition, she made reference about account\nwith Syndicate Bank, R. K. Puram only whereas according to prosecution,\nthere were two more accounts in which she had been falsely shown as\naccount holder, i.e. account in Bank of India, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and\naccount in Union Bank of India, Moti Bagh. Though, bank balance in both\nsuch accounts was found 'Zero' as on closing of the check period but since\nprosecution had categorically asserted that even these two accounts were\nmanaged and maintained by none other than accused Savitri Singh, it would\nhave been certainly better if she had whispered something or the other about\nthose accounts as well. However, in her examination-in-chief she did not\nmake any      statement      with respect to said two accounts, either way.\nOmission on said aspect indicates that she had no connection with said two\naccounts, else she must have made reference about those as well.\n8.5          During investigation, CBI had taken into possession relevant\ndocuments including account opening form/signature cards and various\ncheques/vouchers.\n8.6          Admittedly, during the investigation, accused Savitri Singh had\ndenied to give her specimen handwriting and, therefore, an adverse inference\nshould be drawn against her and it should be assumed that if she had given\nher specimen handwriting and signatures, it would have established that\nsuch benami accounts belonged to her and that she had signed on the\nrelevant bank documents in a fraudulent manner.\n8.7          Faced with the peculiar denial on the part of accused Savitri\nSingh, prosecution did the next best thing. It took specimen handwriting of\nRaj Kumari Singh and then sent the relevant documents pertaining to said\nthree accounts to CFSL for comparison with such specimen handwriting of\nDW-4 Raj Kumari Singh as well as with available admitted handwriting of\naccused Savitri Singh.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh            Page 29 of 145\n8.8          The report of Dr. M. Ali, Senior Scientific Officer-cum-Assistant\nChemical Examiner clinches the issue in favour of prosecution. Such relevant\nreport has been proved as Ex. PW 189/5 (D-248).\n8.9          I have seen the documents with respect to account of Syndicate\nBank which are contained in D-250. There are some crucial signatures.\nThese include signatures Q-1 and Q-2, Q-2/1 on the account opening\nform/specimen card and various other signatures on cheques and vouchers\ni.e. Q-3 to Q-8 and Q-19/1. The documents with respect to Union Bank of\nIndia, Moti Bagh are contained in D-251 and the signatures of the alleged\naccount holder, i.e. Raj Kumari Singh are on Q-9, Q-9/1. There are other\nsignatures also which have been assigned number as Q-10 to Q-14 and Q-\n21. The documents related to Bank of India, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg\nbranch are contained in D-263 which, inter-alia, contain signature of the\nalleged account holder, i.e. Raj Kumari Singh at Q-181/1 on one cheque\ndated 24.7.1986.\n8.10         As per the specific report of Dr. Ali, all these signatures\nappearing in account opening form/specimen signature cards as well as on\nsome of the cheques/vouchers were found to be of none other than accused\nSavitri Singh. To make things worse for defence, Dr. Ali also opined that some\nof these questioned signatures as well as some of the questioned writings\nwith respect to said three bank accounts did not stand connected with\nspecimen    writing/signatures         (Mark      S-1    to   S-3)   and      admitted\nhandwriting/signatures (A-1 to A-11) of Raj Kumari Singh. Such report makes\nit amply evident that the said three accounts had been opened by accused\nSavitri Singh and she was managing the same.\n8.11         Moreover, Raj Kumari Singh is resident of Shahpura, Bhopal.\nShe got married in the year 1979 and there was no reason for her to have\nopened any such bank account in Delhi. Though she tried to own up account\nNo. 320030 of Syndicate Bank, R. K. Puram, fact remains that report of Dr.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                     Page 30 of 145\nAli clearly belies her stand. Quite possibly, being a close relative of accused\nSavitri Singh, she has tried to help her out by owning up these forged\ndocuments, manifestly, prepared by Savitri Singh.\n8.12           Since, I have dealt with the bank account, allegedly in the name\nof Raj Kumari Singh, it would be important to deal with any FDR or CDR in\nher name right here. As far as Annexure IV(a) of charge sheet is concerned,\nthere is no FDR or CDR in the name of Raj Kumari Singh.\n8.13           However, there are three CDRs of Oriental Bank of Commerce,\nMunirka, which are mentioned at serial no. 35 to 37 as per following details:-\nSl.   Name      of FD FD No. & Date                  FD amount   Source\n       No.   Holder     SBA/C\n             No.\n       35.

According to her, such FDRs were\ngot prepared from Oriental Bank of Commerce, Munirka Branch in the year\n1989. These CDRs have been got issued from Oriental Bank of Commerce\nwhere admittedly, accused Savitri Singh was also having an account. Raj\nKumari Singh was having no account with said branch of Oriental Bank of\nCommerce and, therefore, it is hard to believe that she would come to Delhi\nfrom Bhopal for said insignificant purpose.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                    Page 31 of 145\n8.15          PW-14 Sh. V.P.S. Punia has also been examined by\nprosecution with respect to said three CDRs of Oriental Bank of Commerce.\nHe has, however, claimed that these FDRs/CDRs had nothing to do with him\nor any of his family members.\n8.16          Fact remains that in view of the aforesaid discussion, it\nbecomes evident that these three CDRs were owned by none other than\naccused Savitri Singh. Moreover, there is one fact which clearly corroborates\nthat accused Savitri Singh was the actual holder of the amount under said\nthree CDRs. Reference be made to search-cum-seizure memo Ex. PW 168/1\n(part of D-382). When locker No. 907 of PNB, Green Park Branch was got\ndrilled opened, it was found containing various articles of gold jewellery, silver\ncoins besides cash and other bank related documents. One bunch of FDRs\nwas also recovered and all the aforesaid three CDRs No. 522/91, 523/91 and\n524/91 were also found lying in said locker. If at all these CDRs had been got\nprepared by Raj Kumari Singh herself, there was no reason or occasion for\nher to have parted with the same. Recovery of these CDRs from the\nexclusive possession of accused Savitri Singh from her locker and also in\nview of the aforesaid report of Handwriting Expert, I am persuaded to hold\nthat these CDRs were owned by accused Savitri Singh. Right here, I would\nalso hasten to add that various bank accounts held with OBC, Munirka\nBranch and as mentioned at Sr. No. 38 to Sr. 43 of Annexure-IV (b) also\nstand attributed to accused Savitri Singh particularly in light of testimony of\nPW42 Sh. N.K. Madan who has proved the relevant documents related to\naccount opening and whose testimony clearly indicates that these accounts\nwere opened under the guardianship of accused Savitri Singh.\n8.17          Let me now refer to one asset i.e. Flat No. IV/002 at Vaishali\nHousing Scheme, Ghaziabad, U.P., mentioned at serial no. 13 of Annexure-\nIV, allegedly in the name of Ms. Raj Kumari Singh. The concerned official\nfrom Ghaziabad Development Authority has proved the relevant documents.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 32 of 145\n8.18          Reference be made to the testimony of PW-19 Uma Malik.\nAccording to her deposition, one application Ex. PW 19/A signed by Savitri\nSingh and Raj Kumari Singh was received by them in their office but the\napplicant was Mrs. Savitri Singh wife of Ram Singh. Along with      application,\nan amount of Rs. 31010/- was deposited by Savitri Singh vide DD and Savitri\nSingh was allotted said house. The estimated cost of same was Rs.\n31,00,000/-. It will be also important to mention here that part payment for\nsaid allotment had been made from the aforesaid referred bank account of\nSyndicate Bank, R. K. Puram. I have already noticed that such account was\nactually owned by accused Savitri Singh alone. Though according to Raj\nKumari Singh, she herself had purchased the said property and deposited the\namount but fact remains that even as per the application, though it was a joint\napplication, the allotment application was, primarily, on behalf of Savitri Devi\nwho was shown as first applicant.\n8.19          Such application bears signature of applicants i.e. Savitri Singh\n(Q-498 and Q-504) and Raj Kumari Singh at Q-499. However, as per report\nof GEQD, these three signatures were found to be of none other than\naccused Savitri Singh herself. Reference be made to report Ex. PW 189/3.\nMoreover, one more receipt, whereby the payment of Rs. 62,000/- was made\nto Ghaziabad Development Authority has been proved as Ex. PW 19/E. Such\nreceipt contains purported signature of Raj Kumari Singh at Q-487. As per\nreport of GEQD, again, such signatures were found to be of accused Savitri\nSingh.\n8.20          Therefore, it becomes apparent that such property of Vaishali\nbelonged to accused Savitri Singh alone.\n8.21          There is one more immovable asset which though is in the\nname of Raj Kumari Singh but allegedly owned by accused Savitri Singh. It is\nas per the following details:\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 33 of 145\nSl. Property    Details      & Date of initial Worth of D.

Such application and the attached challan\ncontain signatures of Raj Kumari Singh at points Q-446, Q-447, Q-448/2 and\nQ-449. Alleged handwriting of Raj Kumari Singh are at point Q-445, Q-448/1\nand Q-450.       As per report of GQED, which has been proved as Ex. PW\n189/3, all these questioned handwritings and signature rather matched with\nthe handwriting and signature of accused Savitri Singh. Therefore, it is\nevident that said application for allotment was moved by Savitri Singh in false\nname of Raj Kumari Singh.\n8.23            Right here, I would also comment that as far as the aforesaid\naspect related to application for allotment of said plot of Indira Puram is\nconcerned, DW-4 Raj Kumari Singh categorically claimed that she had not\napplied for any plot except for the aforesaid plot of Vaishali. Thus, said\ninvestment has to be inferred as the one made by accused Savitri Singh.\nSince the amount had been merely invested for allotment purpose and since\nthe property had not, actually, been allotted by the close of the check period,\nit should not have been, strictly speaking, construed as an acquisition of\nimmovable property and should have been treated as expenditure amount.\nHowever, in ultimate calculation process, it would not make much difference.\n8.24            There is one more property which is allegedly in the joint name\nof Raj Kumari and Jitender Kumar Singh (son of accused) which is as under:-\nCBI Vs.

Testimony of PW -50 Ramesh Kohli is important. He\nwas partner of firm M/s K.K. Estate Developers which had sold the aforesaid\nproperty. Though the sale deed is found in the name of Mrs. Raj Kumari\nSingh and Mr. Jitender Kumar Singh but fact remains that PW-50 Ramesh\nKohli has categorically claimed in his deposition that the application form for\nsuch allotment was Ex. PW 50/B. Along with such application form, receipt\nissued by Developer has been proved as Ex. PW 18/E which was in lieu of\nCheque No. 567297 of Rs. 8,000/- dated 7.3.1989 drawn on Syndicate Bank,\nR.K. Puram Branch towards earnest money. In cross-examination, this\nwitness also claimed that since at the time of sale, presence of the purchaser\nwas not required, the purchaser was not present.\n8.26            I have already discussed above that the aforesaid bank account\nof Syndicate Bank was being controlled and managed by accused Savitri\nSingh only. Moreover, Raj Kumari Singh had graced the witness box as\ndefence witness and she did not utter even a single word regarding her being\nowner of any such property. On the contrary, she categorically stated that she\ndid not possess any other property. Moreover, as regards sale consideration\nof Rs. 14,000/- no light has been thrown either by DW-4 Raj Kumari Singh or\nby her husband Ram Avatar Singh (DW-5) as to how such amount was\narranged by them. There is no intimation about said investment and intended\nacquisition by Ram Avatar to his employer.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                   Page 35 of 145\n8.27             More importantly, Raj Kumari Singh, as already noted above,\ndisowned her Objection Petition Ex. DW 4/9. Therefore, for all practical\npurposes, such property is to be construed as benami property held by\naccused Savitri Singh.\nAssets held by Sh. Ram Avtar Singh\n\n\n9.0              As per details appearing in Annexure-IV of the charge-sheet,\ntwo properties were though acquired in the name of Ram Avtar Singh yet\naccording to prosecution, said two properties were owned by accused\npersons and Ram Avtar Singh had never applied for the following said two\nproperties.\n9.1              One property is of Paschim Vihar and other is the investment\nmade for allotment of plot with Greater Noida.

He deposed that he had applied for DDA Flat in\nthe year 1979 and property no. 8/484, Paschim Vihar was allotted to him by\nDDA. In his examination-in-chief, he made reference to various documents\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                        Page 36 of 145\ncontained in D281 to D-284 and also owned up number of signatures\nappearing at several places. He claimed that even the challans were filled up\nby him in his handwriting and were bearing his signatures. He admitted his\nsignatures on following documents:\nS. No.        Brief Description of     Exhibit       Q Number\n                                Document           Number\n\n            1           Application               DW5/6       Q519\n\n            2           Affidavit                 DW5/5       Q520/1 & Q520/2\n\n            3           Undertaking               DW5/4       Q521\n\n            4           Challan                   DW5/2                --\n\n            5           Challan                   DW5/3                --\n\n            6           Specimen signature        PW13/A      Q523/1\n7           Challan                   PW66/C      Q543/2\n8           Challan                   PW66/B      Q544/2\n9.3             It is also important to mention that he was working as\nAccountant in MP Forest Development Corporation, Bhopal. His office was\nalso maintaining his personal files. During investigation, such personal files\nEx. DW5/P1 (D-342) and Ex. DW5/P2 (D-343) were collected. DW5 Sh. Ram\nAvtar Singh claimed that he had intimated his office regarding the aforesaid\nallotment of DDA Flat but when he was shown said personal files, he had to\ncut sorry figure and had to admit that there was no such intimation to that\neffect by him to his office. This, automatically, makes his testimony totally\nunreliable. His such personal files were also containing number of leave\napplications and other documents which were containing his handwriting and\nsignatures as well and it would need no discerning eyes to distinguish\nbetween the signatures appearing on such admitted documents in his\npersonal files and the signatures appearing in the file related to allotment of\nflat by DDA. These are totally different. Signatures appearing in the\ncorrespondence made with DDA do not match 'even a bit' with the signatures\nappearing in the personal files. This has potential to indicate that he had\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                       Page 37 of 145\nnever, actually, applied for any such property and that his brother Ram Singh\nand accused Savitri Singh were pulling the strings and were using his name\nfor the purpose of acquisition of said flat of DDA.\n9.4           There is one more investment related to Greater Noida\nIndustrial Development Authority.\n9.5           DW5 Sh. Ram Avtar Singh claimed in his examination-in-chief\nthat he had applied for such flat on 27.03.1992 and deposited Rs. 8,500/-\nvide receipt dated 27.03.1992. He made reference to such receipt as well\nand proved the same as Ex. DW5/8. He claimed that handwriting contained in\nsaid receipt was his handwriting. Such portion was encircled as Q627. Such\nfile of Greater Noida also contained one affidavit which was bearing signature\nof same Sh. Ram Avtar Singh at Q632 & Q633. Fact remains that even these\nsignatures do not match with his admitted signatures. Moreover, there is no\nintimation by him to his department with respect to investment/allotment\nregarding any such flat. In the aforesaid backdrop, the testimony of GEQD\nalso assumes immense importance. I have seen report Ex. PW189/3 of Dr.\nAli and at page 6 of his said report, he has categorically observed that\nhandwriting evidence pointed to the writer of admitted handwriting of Savitri\nSingh being the person responsible for various questioned writings and\nsignatures including writings/ signatures at points Q-626 to Q-629 and Q-632\nto Q-637.\n9.6           It will be also important to mention here that Sh. Ram Avtar\nSingh had sent a letter to accused Ram Singh and such letter was seized\nduring the investigation. It was containing handwriting of Sh. Ram Avtar Singh\nbesides his signatures. These were marked as Q-734, Q-735, Q-735A and Q-\n735B. Such questioned portions were tallied with the available admitted\nhandwriting of Sh. Ram Avtar Singh as available in his leave applications and\nwere marked as A-117 to A-134 and A-137 to A-146. As per report Ex.\nPW189/2 of Dr. Ali, the admitted handwriting of Ram Avtar Singh matched\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 38 of 145\nwith the questioned writing Q-734 and Q-735A. Thus, it stood established that\nsaid letter D-417 (xxiv) had been written by none other than Ram Avtar Singh.\nThe contents of said letter clearly reflects the poor financial condition of Sh.\nRam Avtar Singh which also is indicative of the fact that Sh.

In this regard, strong reliance\nhas been placed upon the deposition of DW-6 Kusum Lata.\n10.3          I have carefully gone through the deposition of Kusum Lata.\nAdmittedly, she claimed that she had bank accounts in Bank of Baroda,\nBahadur Shah Zafar Marg, Central Bank of India, Press Area and Canara\nBank, Munirka branch. She also made reference to various documents with\nrespect to the said accounts as well as FDRs obtained through such\naccounts.\n10.4          In her cross-examination, she claimed that she was married in\nthe year 1979. Her husband was working as Deputy Regional Marketing\nOfficer. When asked about his salary in the year 1979, she ducked the\nanswer claiming that she did not remember the same. Her husband remained\nposted at various places at Farukhabad, Bijnour, Muradabad, Banda,\nLaliptpur, Bulandshahar, Orai, Aligarh, Basti Jhansi, Calcutta, Gorkhpur and\nAzamgarh etc.      He never remained posted in Delhi and it is indeed little\nsurprising as to why she opened these three accounts in Delhi, more so,\nwhen even as per her own version, she rarely used to come to Delhi i.e. only\nonce or twice a year.\n10.5          Ld. Sr. PP has, again, drawn my attention towards the opinion\nof GEQD and claimed that various documents related to aforesaid accounts\nand FDRs were, in fact, found having signatures of accused Savitri Singh.\nReference has been made to signatures appearing at Q-153 and Q-139 with\nrespect to Canara Bank, Q-167 and Q-168 with respect to Bank of India and\nCBI Vs.

I\nhave seen all these documents contained in D-260, D-262 and D-264\nrespectively. I have also seen the report of GEQD. According to said report,\nthe aforesaid signatures stand attributed to accused Savitri Singh. This\nclearly indicates that these were benami accounts and though these were\nopened in the name of Kusum Lata, these were managed by accused Savitri\nSingh, to the exclusion of all others including Kusum Lata.\nASSETS IN THE NAME OF ASHOK KUMAR SINGH\n\n11.0             Ashok Kumar Singh is real brother of accused Ram Singh.\n11.1             According to CBI, he was merely a student at the relevant time\nand had no personal income or personal asset and, therefore, it was not\npossible for him to have purchased any immovable property. It has also been\ncontended that properties acquired in his name are actually owned by\naccused persons and even the bank accounts were being controlled by\naccused persons.\n11.2             Following immovable properties, bank deposits and saving bank\naccounts have been shown to be in name of Sh.

Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                             Page 42 of 145\n11.3          Sh. Ashok Kumar Singh has entered into witness box as DW1.\n\n\n11.4          I have seen his testimony very carefully. He did make reference\nto bank accounts of Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Canara Bank.\nHe did claim that all these accounts were opened by him and he owned up\nthe account opening forms and also made reference to pay-in-slips claiming\nthat such amount was deposited by him. As regards amount deposited in\naccount no. 332, Bank of India, District Farukhabad, he claimed that such\naccount used to be operated by his mother Smt. Ram Kali. In his cross-\nexamination, he claimed that he completed his MBBS in the year 1994 and\nhis earning started from 01.04.1994 with the beginning of his internship. He\nalso deposed that his mother was having agriculture income and income by\nselling milk though he failed to quantify the same. According to him, he left\nhis native village when he was 6-7 years of age and started living with his\nelder brother Ram Singh wherever he remained posted. Though he remained\nwith his brother-accused Ram Singh but according to him, his educational\nexpenses were borne by his mother Smt. Ram Kali. As regards immovable\nproperty, he claimed that as far as he remembered, his mother Ram Kali had\npurchased a plot in the year 1986-87 supplementing further that he was not\naware as to who had made the payment for such plot. He also claimed that\napplication Ex. PW1/4 (part of D-27) was bearing his signatures whereby he\nhad applied for membership of Poornima Group Housing Society. Except for\nthe aforesaid, he did not make any reference about any immovable property.\n11.5          Undoubtedly, bank account can be opened even if a person is\nnot earning anything and even if the person is minor or a student. Such fact\nwould not be, in itself, sufficient to suspect anything.\n11.6          As far as Plot No. 240, Anand Kunj, Wazid Pur is concerned,\naccording to Sh. Rao, a total investment of Rs. 19,750/- was made and\nthough property was purchased in the name of Ashok Kumar Singh yet the\nentire consideration was paid by accused Savitri Singh and her husband.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh           Page 43 of 145\n11.7         Such contention has been resisted by defence.\n11.8         I have seen the relevant documents regarding purchase of the\nproperty which are contained in D-2 as well as the bank record of Canara\nBank which is contained in D-101 to D-103. Account opening form of Munirka\nBranch of Canara Bank has been proved as Ex. PW29/C-2 and statement of\naccount has been proved as Ex. PW29/C (D-103). It will be important to\nmention that such bank account was opened way back in the year 1983 and\nthere are transactions regarding deposits and withdrawal right from the\nbeginning.   As per said statement of account, on 08.03.1989 two cash\ndeposits of Rs. 2,800/- & Rs. 2,600/- were made in said account and with the\nhelp of said amount as well as the balance already lying in said account,\ncheque in a sum of Rs. 8,000/- was prepared in the name of M/s Kay Kay\nEstates for acquiring said property. Investigating agency was also able to\ncollect various deposit slips/vouchers but fact remains that as far as the\naforesaid two vital cash deposits are concerned, it could not lay its hands\nupon those vouchers/ pay-in-slips.\n11.9         As per the record of M/s Kay Kay Estates, a sum of Rs. 8,000/-\nwas paid initially vide cheque and thereafter a sum of Rs. 10,000/- was\ndeposited in cash. The cash deposit-slip of Rs. 10,000/- has been proved as\nEx. PW18/B. If testimony of PW48 Pawan Kochar is to be believed then\naccording to him, the plot was purchased by Ashok Kumar Singh and sale\namount was paid by Ashok Kumar Singh.                  Total sale amount was Rs.\n18,000/- and Ashok Kumar Singh also bore the expenses of Rs. 1,750/-\ntowards stamp duty.\n11.10        Be that as it may, there is no convincing material on record\nwhich may show that said bank account was maintained and controlled by\naccused Savitri Singh or that payment for purchasing the aforesaid plot was\nmade by Savitri Singh and not by Ashok Kumar Singh.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                  Page 44 of 145\n11.11         According to Sh. Rao, two more aspects require intense\nconsideration. Firstly, when the account was opened with the Canara Bank,\nAshok Kumar Singh had not attained the age of discretion and he was still a\nstudent and less than 18 years of age. Bank record does not reflect any such\nthing and there are no signatures of anyone as guardian. As per Sh. Rao, the\nage of the account-holder was suppressed at the time of the opening of\naccount. Moreover, one old cash deposit receipt of 02.021986 of Rs. 1,000/-\nindicates that deposit was made by none other than accused Savitri Singh\nand, therefore, there is a possibility that such account was being controlled by\naccused persons and not by Ashok Kumar Singh. Secondly, as per Sh. Rao,\nAshok Kumar Singh entered into witness box but did not make any specific\nreference about the aforesaid property at all. His deposition is limited to one\napplication regarding seeking membership of Poornima Group Housing\nSociety and he has not deposed about his purchasing any other property.\nSuch omission becomes little inconsequential keeping in mind the fact that\nAshok Kumar Singh was a student at that time and investment in his name\ncould have always been made by his parents.             There is little room for\nspeculation and, in case, there is any doubt, benefit needs to be given to\naccused. Thus, net result is evident. There is not enough of evidence to show\nthat such payment was made by accused and accused only. Therefore, I am\npersuaded to exclude the property from the assets of accused, the\npossession of which, even otherwise, is still stated to be with the developers.\n11.12         Simultaneously, said account being old account and for want of\ninspiring material, entry mentioned at serial no. 27 of Annexure-IV (b) and\nentry no. 25 of Annexure-IV (a) related to same bank is liable to be excluded.\nThough PW77 Subhash Chand Garg proved KDR No. 179/91 for Rs.\n4,301.25 (invested amount) as Ex. PW77/10 and bank record has also been\nproved but it could not be substantiated by CBI in desired manner that it was\na benami account of accused. There is a odd chance that his parents must\nhave contributed towards his educational expenses as well and, therefore, a\nbank account had been opened for him. There is no material which may\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 45 of 145\nsuggest that FDRs mentioned at serial no. 15 and 39 of Annexure IV(b) were\nbeing held as benami by accused.\n11.13        As regards property mentioned at serial no. 7, which is stated to\nbe of Palam, I would reiterate that Ashok Kumar Singh had made reference\nabout said property in his deposition.           He claimed that amount for the\npurpose of purchasing said property was paid by his mother Smt. Ram Kali. I\nhave seen the relevant documents in this regard. This property was earlier\nowned by one Sh. Ram Mehar Sharma. He sold the same to Ms. Santosh\nKumari Yadav and Santosh Kumari Yadav thereafter sold the same to Ashok\nKumar Singh in the year 1989. GPA, deed of agreement, receipt and affidavit\nhave been proved as Ex. PW8/C, Ex. PW8/D, Ex. PW8/F and Ex. PW8/E\nrespectively. Interestingly, as per the sale agreement, sale consideration has\nbeen shown as Rs. 45,000/- and even receipt executed by Santosh Kumari\nYadav (Ex. PW8/F) indicates that she had received a sum of Rs. 45,000/-\nfrom Ashok Kumar Singh for said property. However, to make the situation\ncomplex, one more receipt (Ex. PW8/B) was issued by Sh. Suhender Singh\nYadav (husband of Santosh Kumari Yadav) in which, sale price has been\nmentioned either as Rs. 47,060/- or as Rs. 1,47,060/-.           Confusion has\ncropped up because of the overwriting over the first numerical. I have seen\ntestimony of PW8 Sh. Suhender Singh Yadav. He deposed that Santosh\nKumari Yadav was his wife and was owner of plot in Khasra No. 46/21, Raj\nNagar Extension Part-II, Palam, New Delhi and she had sold the same. He\ndeposed that though such sale transaction was with Ram Singh and his wife,\nthe receipt was executed in favour of Ashok Kumar Singh. He deposed that\nhe had issued the receipt in favour of Ashok Kumar as Ashok Kumar Singh\nwas present there and he was told that receipt of earnest money be issued in\nfavour of Ashok Kumar. He also signed as witness on such receipt. He also\ndeposed that his wife had executed receipt and affidavit but he did not explain\nand elucidate as to how the receipt executed by his wife was showing sale\nconsideration as Rs. 45,000/- and his own receipt as Rs. 1,47,060/-. His\ndeposition contradicts the executed documents on two vital aspects i.e. about\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 46 of 145\nthe actual buyer and actual sale consideration. His such oral evidence has\nno evidentiary value in view of\nSections 91\n&\n92\nof Indian Evidence Act.\n11.14          Moreover, seller was Santosh Kumari Yadav and she should\nhave entered into witness box to prove said vital aspects. A mere witness to\nagreement to sell and receipt should not be permitted to impeach the\ncontents in the aforesaid manner. On one hand, he is a witness and on the\nother, he is trying to disown the contents of such documents. Moreover, one\nmore attesting witness PW10 Jagat Singh has turned hostile and did not\nreveal anything in favour of prosecution which could even remotely indicate\nthat any such amount was actually invested by accused.                        In view of\naforesaid, there is perplexity about the exact sale consideration. Moreover,\nCBI has also failed to prove that such sale consideration amount had come\nfrom accused alone.\n11.15          Coming to property mentioned at serial no. 11 which happens to\nbe of Village Namoli. District Bulandshahar, UP, reference be made to\ntestimony of PW107 H.S. Chowdhary who was Managing Director in H.\nChowdhary Estate Pvt. Ltd. He proved various entries maintained in ledger\nwith respect to sale of plot to Sh. Ashok Kumar Singh as well as to Jitender\nKumar and Smt. Ram Kali. He has proved his letter Ex. PW107/1 and the\nledger statement as Ex. PW107/5. Relevant receipts have been proved as\nEx. PW107/2 collectively and as per these receipts, he had received following\namount from Sh. Ashok Kumar Singh regarding sale of Plot No. E-346:-\nS. No. Amount        Date         Mode     Name of Bank\n\n        1     Rs. 6,800.00   23.04.1989   Cheque Moti Bagh Branch of UBI of Savitri\n                                                 Singh\n\n        2     Rs. 6,800.00   08.11.1989   Cash                    --\n\n        3     Rs. 4,302.00   08.11.1990   Cheque Canara Bank, Munirka Branch of\n                                                 Ashok Kumar Singh\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                       Page 47 of 145\n11.16        Statement of account of UBI Moti Bagh Branch has also been\nduly admitted as Ex. P-841 (D-164). However, there is no evidence that such\ninvestment was a benami one. Merely because, one payment came from the\nbank of accused Savitri Singh, it cannot be robotically inferred that Ashok\nKumar Singh had no connection with such property.\n11.17        Since I have gone through the testimony of PW107 Sh. H.S.\nChowdhary, it would be also appropriate to mention right here that in view of\nhis testimony and documents proved by him, it stands proved that plot no. E-\n345 mentioned at Sr. No. 12 of Annexure-IV was sold in the name of Smt.\nRam Kali for Rs. 16,275/- and as regards plot mentioned at serial no. 10,\npayment of Rs. 22,000/- was made. Such investment was made in the name\nof Sh. Jitender Kumar Singh. Receipt has been proved as Ex. PW 107/3\nwhich clearly suggests that a plot was booked against payment of Rs.\n22,000/-. In this regard, consideration had come by a cheque issued from the\nBank Account owned by accused Savitri with Central Bank of India, Khan\nMarket. Her statement of account Ex. PW 4/C (part of D-128) also clearly\nindicates that such amount of Rs. 22,000/- was debited from her account in\nfavour of M/s Chowdhary Estates Pvt. Ltd. Bald assertion of disowning the\nbank account as well as the property on the basis that she is not known as\nSavitri Devi has no legs to stand upon. Thus, such allotment is of accused.\n11.18        However, since Smt. Ram Kali had her own income, it cannot\nbe straightaway assumed that it was benami property owned by accused.\nTherefore, such property mentioned at serial no. 12 of Annexure-IV,\npurchased in the name of Ram Kali, is liable to excluded from the assets. I\nwould discuss said aspect in detail when I consider the assets held in the\nname of Ram Kali.\n11.19        As regards property mentioned at serial no. 22, DW1 Ashok\nKumar Singh himself admitted in his deposition that he had applied for\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 48 of 145\nmembership in Poornima Group Housing Society.                He admitted the\napplication form as well. He had moved said application in the year 1989\nwhen he was around 23 years of age. Documents related to his membership\nwere received by PW197 Sh. M.C. Joshi, DSP/CBI vide letter dated\n04.05.1995. Such letter has been exhibited as Ex. PW197/39. Such letter\nwas sent by Sh. K.S. Joshi who was President of said Housing Society. Sh.\nK.S. Joshi has also entered into witness box as PW88 and he merely claimed\nthat some vouchers were bearing signatures of his father who was also\nhaving account in Union Bank of India. He did claim that he along with some\nother persons had formed the aforesaid Group Housing Society.                 He,\nhowever, pleaded his complete ignorance about accused Savitri Singh in\ncontext of said Society.      I have seen documents contained in D-27 and\nthough the details were provided by society regarding the payments received\nfrom the applicant but fact remains that these details have not been proved in\nthe desired manner. It seems that a sum of Rs. 35,000/- was deposited by\nthe applicant Ashok Kumar Singh with the aforesaid society but there is no\nevidence that such amount was paid by accused persons on behalf of\napplicant Ashok Kumar Singh to achieve benami hold over the same. Some\nsuch payments have rather been made from the accounts of Ram Kali, Puttu\nLal and Ashok Kumar Singh himself.\n11.20         Be that as it may, said asset does not stand proved and the\ninvestment related to said membership cannot be attributed to accused\npersons.\n11.21         However, as regards investment of Rs. 8,500/- (at serial no. 31)\nfor obtaining plot in Greater Noida vide application no. 6474 {Ex. PW 7/12 (D-\n290)} and investment of Rs. 7,670/- (at serial no. 36) for seeking plot in Indira\nPuram under SFS (application contained in D-277), there is one important\naspect which portrays that these were benami transactions.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 49 of 145\n11.22         D-290 purportedly contains signature of applicant Ashok Kumar\nSingh at point Q-552 and the other application contains his alleged signature\nat point Q-468 and Q-469 in the front side. These signatures matched with\nthe admitted signatures of Savitri Singh as is evident from report Ex. PW\n189/3 of Dr. Ali. I can understand that any family member can fill up the\ndetails in the form, but no such family member, even the closest one, has any\nbusiness to sign in the name of other while submitting such application. It\nshows criminality only. It clearly indicates that investment has been made\nsimply in the name of Ashok Kumar Singh, without his knowledge or consent.\nMoreover, Ashok Kumar Singh entered into witness box and he did not make\neven a whisper about applying any such property with Greater Noida or\nGhaziabad Development Authority and, therefore, these two properties are\nattributed to accused persons.\n11.23         Right here, I would also like to deal with one investment\nallegedly made by accused persons with Ghaziabad Development Authority\non behalf of Puttu Lal. Such property is mentioned at serial no. 35 of\nAnnexure-IV and as per the case of CBI, Puttu Lal had never made any such\ninvestment with Ghaziabad Development Authority. Sh. Rao has contended\nthat the application was moved before Ghaziabad Development Authority but\nPuttu Lal had never signed any such application and rather it was Savitri\nSingh who signed as Puttu Lal. I have seen such application Ex. PW 61/D\n(D-277). Such application bears alleged signatures of Puttu Lal at points Q-\n458, Q-461, Q-463/1, Q-463/2 and 464. Fact, however, remains that these\nsignatures did not match with the admitted signatures of Savitri Devi. Thus, it\nwill be difficult to hold said property as benami one.\n11.24         There is one more important aspect of the case, Puttu Lal,\nduring investigation, told CBI that he had never booked any flat/plot with\nGhaziabad Development Authority and did not put his signatures on any such\napplication but when he entered into witness box, he took a somersault and\ndid not reveal any such thing. Therefore, he was cross-examined by the\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 50 of 145\nprosecution with permission of the court and even during such cross-\nexamination, he remained adamant and rather positively asserted that he\nhimself   had booked the plot in his name with Ghaziabad Development\nAuthority and he also claimed that such application Ex. PW 61/D was bearing\nhis signatures. In view of the hostile testimony of Puttu Lal, it would be\ndifficult to assume that the said investment of Rs. 22020/- was benami\ninvestment made by accused persons.\n11.25          Since I have taken up the aforesaid two files related to\nGhaziabad Development Authority and Noida, it would be appropriate to\nmake mention about the investment made on behalf of Sh. Ram Prakash\nSingh with respect to property mentioned at Sr. No. 30 & Sr. No. 34 of\nAnnexure-IV.\n11.26          File D-277 contains one application form allegedly submitted by\nRam Prakash Singh whereby he had applied for plot in Indira Puram Scheme\nand made payment of Rs. 7,670/-. Such property is mentioned at serial no.\n34. Such application bears purported signatures of Sh. Ram Prakash Singh\nat Q452, Q453/1, Q453/2, Q454 & Q456. These signatures too did not match\nwith the admitted signature of accused Savitri Singh. Sh. Ram Prakash Singh\nwas also examined in defence. In his examination-in-chief, though DW2 Ram\nPrakash Singh did not make reference about his applying for any such\nproperty in Ghaziabad Development Authority, the prosecution could have\neasily confronted him with said application. Perhaps, feeling that he had\nentered into witness box as a defence witness and, therefore, he would not\nhave supported the case of prosecution on said aspect as well, it seems that\nCBI did not confront him with said application.\n11.27          Similarly, with respect to another application, which was moved\nbefore Noida Authority, situation is not very rosy from the perspective of\nprosecution.    Copy of application is contained in file Ex. PW71/V (D-21).\nInvestment of Rs. 8,500/- was made on 10.04.1992.         Such investment is\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh            Page 51 of 145\nmentioned at serial no. 30 of Annexure-IV and according to the objection Ex.\nDW2/2 filed by Sh. Ram Prakash Singh, he had applied for the aforesaid\nproperty. There is nothing on record that said sum of Rs. 8,500/- was\ninvested by accused persons in the name of Sh. Ram Prakash Singh.\nThough the counterfoil of deposit receipt seems to be in the handwriting of\naccused Savitri Singh, but such said mere fact would not mean that even the\ninvestment was made by Savitri Singh. There is no additional corroborating\nmaterial to hold so and, therefore, said two properties in the name of Ram\nPrakash Singh are liable to be excluded.\n11.28        I have seen the details regarding SB Account No. 332 which Sh.\nAshok Kumar Singh was maintaining with Bank of India, Ganipur,\nFarukhabad, UP. Account opening form has been proved as Ex. PW83/1 (D-\n120) and the statement of account has been proved as Ex. PW83/2 ( part of\nD-121). Various deposit slips have been proved as Ex. PW183/3 (part of D-\n121). All such deposits slips bear signatures of depositor Ashok Kumar Singh\nand there is nothing on record which may show that either the cash amount\nwas not deposited by Ashok Kumar Singh or that such amount, mentioned at\nserial no. 11 of Annexure- IV(b) was actually deposited by accused persons.\n11.29        As regards entry mentioned at serial no. 19 of Annexure-IV (b),\nreference be made to the testimony of PW31 A.K. Aggarwal who has proved\nrelevant documents. Account opening form has been proved as Ex. PW31/A\n(D-131). Statement of account has been proved as Ex. PW31/C (D-133).\nVarious deposit slips including one cheque (Ex. PW31/D-14) have been\nproved. Vide said cheque, Ashok Kumar Singh had requested Central Bank\nof India to open one FDR in his name with principal amount of Rs. 21,000/-.\nSuch cheque bears signatures of Ashok Kumar Singh. Nothing has been\nbrought on record which may show that amount deposited in said bank\naccount was actually deposited by accused persons.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 52 of 145\n11.30             As regards account mentioned at serial no. 27, which Ashok\nKumar Singh was maintaining with Canara Bank, Munirka Branch, discussion\nhas already been made in the foregoing paragraphs.\n11.31             As regards bank account mentioned at serial no. 49, reference\nbe made to the testimony of PW117 Sh. G.L. Nankani.                             He has proved\nvarious bank documents including statement of account Ex. PW117/2 (D-\n213). Sh. Ashok Kumar Singh was also holding one FDR issued by said\nBranch of State Bank of India. Such term deposit pay-in-slip of Rs. 12,000/-\nhas been proved as Ex. PW117/4.                     Ashok Kumar Singh was studying\nMedicine in Medical College, Jabal Pur and he had opened one account with\nState Bank of India situated in such college. Account was opened in the year\n1988. I have seen statement of account as well as various entries placed on\nrecord and perusal of same would not suggest any criminality on the part of\naccused persons.             Therefore, I am unable to draw any inference of\nconspiracy or benami transaction or benami acquisition with respect to said\naccount and related FDRs of Ashok Kumar Singh.\nPROPERTY AND ACCOUNTS IN THE NAME OF RAM KALI\n\n\n12.0              Let me now deal with the assets which are allegedly acquired in\nthe name of Smt.

No. C-\n33, Sector-14, Noida, UP was owned by Smt. Ram Kali. I have seen the\ntestimony of PW44 Rajeev Sinha who has appeared on behalf of NOIDA and\nhas made reference about the various documents contained in relevant file\nEx. PW44/A (D-4).\n12.2             According to his testimony, initially, Smt. Ram Kali had been\nallotted plot in Sector-11, Noida but later on she was allotted Plot No. C-33 in\nSector-14, Noida, UP. According to him, payments were made by the party\nthrough challans. I have seen the relevant documents contained in D-4 and it\nis evident that even the possession certificate had been issued to Smt. Ram\nKali way back on 02.02.1981. Thus, acquisition is of prior to the check period.\nThere is nothing to show that any payment of consideration amount for\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                           Page 54 of 145\nacquiring said plot was made by accused. Sh. Pehlwan Singh (husband of\nSmt. Ram Kali) must have contributed and for want of any substantial\nevidence, it cannot be robotically inferred that father of accused Ram Singh\nwas penniless or that he was living in acute penury and was unable to buy\nproperty in the name of his wife.\n12.3          According to prosecution, acquisition cost of said plot was Rs.\n48,175 and construction was raised over such plot during the check period\nand the cost of such construction was Rs. 3,27,253/- and, therefore, the total\nvalue of the asset has been taken as Rs. 3,75,428/- as on close of check\nperiod.\n12.4          In this regard, strong reliance has been placed upon the\ntestimony of PW57 Sh. N.K. Khatri, Valuer. He was posted as Engineer in\nCPWD and as per request of CBI, he had visited the aforesaid plot and\nprepared valuation report dated 04.11.1994 I have seen the aforesaid report\nEx. PW57/A (D-5). It is mentioned in the report that construction was initiated\nin September 1986 and was completed in the month of April 1988 but it is not\nclear who had provided such vital information to Sh. Khatri. There does not\nseem to be any other witness who might have claimed that construction was\nraised between 1986 and 1988.\n12.5          There are two important aspects with respect to the aforesaid\nconstruction. Firstly, whether the construction had been carried out during\nthe check period or not. Secondly, if yes, who had incurred the expenditure\nof construction.\n12.6          Sh. Rao has asserted that during investigation, CBI was able to\ncontact Sh. Baljeet Singh (LW187). He was the one who had carried out the\naforesaid construction during the aforesaid period and according to his\nstatement recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C., substantial amount of\napproximately Rs. 7 lacs was spent in the aforesaid construction.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 55 of 145\nUnfortunately, he died before his evidence could be recorded during the trial.\nHis statement recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. during investigation does\nnot carry any evidentiary value.\n12.7         My attention has also been drawn towards the testimony of\nPW118 Sh. O.P. Mehra and PW119 Smt. Anju Mehra who were residing as\ntenants in the aforesaid plot and were paying rent @ Rs. 1,000/- per to Smt.\nRam Kali. This, at least, goes on to show that Smt. Ram Kali was having\nrental income. Both these witnesses did not support the case of prosecution\nand, therefore, they were declared hostile and were cross-examined by the\nprosecution with the permission of the Court. They both out-rightly denied\nthat rent was ever paid to accused Ram Singh in cash or that they had taken\nflat on rent from accused Ram Singh. According to them, they either used to\npay the rent to Smt. Ram Kali or used to deposit the same in the account of\nSmt. Ram Kali which she was having with Central Bank of India, Noida.\nTheir evidence does not throw any light with respect to the construction over\nsaid plot.\n12.8         PW17 Dr. Rajiv Bhasin has also been examined from the\nneighbourhood.     He was earlier having his residence-cum-clinic at C-34,\nSector-14, Noida which was got constructed by his parents in the year 1986-\n87. He deposed that he used to visit said house during the construction\noccasionally and during that period, he had also seen construction being\ncarried out at C-33. He claimed that he had seen Mrs. Singh (accused Savitri\nSingh) three or four times at the site of construction. Even if, it is assumed\nthat Savitri Singh was present at the construction site on some such\noccasions, it would not automatically prove either the construction cost or the\nfact that such construction cost was borne by accused only.\n12.9         Thus, the construction cost does not stand proved in the\ndesired manner.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 56 of 145\n12.10           In relation to acquisition of property of Raj Nagar, Palam\nmentioned at serial no. 5, reference be made to the testimony of Sh. Rajpal\nDuhal who had sold the aforesaid plot. He deposed that such portion of the\nplot measuring 100 sq. yards was sold by him to Smt. Ram Kali and Jitender\nKumar for a sum of Rs. 48,000/- in November, 1989. GPA, Agreement to sell,\nAffidavit and receipt have been proved by him as Ex. PW 9/A to Ex. PW 9/D\nrespectively.\n12.11           According to learned defence counsel, Smt. Ram Kali has\npurchased the aforesaid property with her own funds. Admittedly, it was\npurchased in the joint names. Learned defence counsel has not been able to\nthrow any light as to from where such amount of Rs. 48,000/- was arranged\nby Smt. Ram Kali. I cannot be oblivious of the fact that since the acquisition\nof immovable property was in the joint names and since one such co-vendee\nwas her son, such acquisition was required to be reported to her employer by\naccused Savitri Singh. Undoubtedly, PW-9 Rajpal Duhal is blowing hot and\ncold. In his examination-in-chief, though he claimed that payment was made\nby Savitri Singh but in his cross-examination, he backed out and claimed that\nwhen the payment was received, neither Ram Singh nor Savitri Singh were\npresent.     It seems to me that his such assertion is patently incorrect.\nPayment was made in cash and he should have at least further elucidated as\nto who else, if not accused persons, had made the payment in cash.\nMoreover, on the same day accused Savitri Singh had also purchased one\nadjacent property, i.e.       Plot No. 1A/B against payment of Rs. 45,000/-.\nRelevant documents in this regard have been duly proved as Ex. PW9/E to\nEx. PW9/H. Savitri Singh has also not bothered to explain as to from where\nshe had arranged the aforesaid cash amount of Rs. 45,000/- for acquiring\nsaid plot.\n12.12           Be that as it may, the property mentioned at serial no. 5 is held\nas acquired by accused persons in the name of their son Jitender Kumar\nSingh and their mother Ram Kali.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 57 of 145\n12.13        As regards plot of Oceans Plaza, Noida UP mentioned at serial\nno. 8, accused Savitri Singh has admitted that it was joint acquisition.\nDefence has asserted that the total investment was of Rs. 1,79,625/- but\naccording to her, she had merely signed as a co-purchaser as her mother-in-\nlaw was not able to sign properly on account of having problem in finger of\nher hand. Unfortunately, no witness from M/s Oceans Construction Industries\nPvt. Ltd. has been examined. I have seen the documents contained in D-31\nand D-78 which have not been proved by anyone. These are not admitted by\nthe defence either. Undoubtedly, in her deposition, she claimed that she had\nmerely invested Rs. 4500/- for acquiring the said property but according to\nlearned Prosecutor there were several other cheques from her bank account.\nDefence has countered the same by pointing out that such bank account was\nnot a single account but rather a joint bank account held with Ram Kali. Be\nthat as it may, since no witness entered into witness box for proving said\ndocuments and since such documents are lying unproved, theory of such\nacquisition by accused does not stand substantiated at all.\n12.14        As regards plot mentioned at serial no. 19, though as per case\nof prosecution and the details mentioned in annexure, said plot was\npurchased in the name of Ram Kali but the documents produced on record\nand proved during the trial clearly go to indicate that such acquisition was in\nthe joint names of Ram Kali and Savitri Singh. Reference be made to\ntestimony of PW-3 Sh. B. Bhushan and PW-52 Malti Puri. PW-52 Malti Puri\nhad purchased the said plot in the year 1984. She has proved the Plot Buyer\nAgreement between her and DLF as Ex. PW 52/A. Thereafter, according to\nher deposition, she sold the aforesaid plot to Ram Kali and Savitri Singh. Her\ntestimony is unrebutted.\n12.15        PW-3 B. Bhushan has appeared on behalf of DLF Universal Ltd.\nand he has also deposed that sale deed dated 22.3.90 (Ex. PW 3/A) was\nexecuted by him on behalf of DLF and was bearing his signatures and as per\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 58 of 145\nsuch sale deed, vendees were Smt. Ram Kali and Savitri Singh. There is no\nsuggestion to any of the aforesaid two witnesses to the contrary. Sale\nconsideration is quite substantial. It is Rs. 3,51,378/- which is quite high,\nparticularly, in view of the fact such amount was paid way back in the year\n1989. Savitri Singh did not inform her employer about said significant\nacquisition. Moreover, defence has also not been able to show that Smt.\nRam Kali was having that much income and assets during those days which\nenabled her to invest in said property in the year 1989. As such, said asset\nis treated as one acquired by accused Savitri Singh.\n12.16        As regards land at Village Kakauli, Farukhabad purchased in\nthe name of Ram Kali at serial no. 27, even the defence admits that the said\nland had been purchased by Ram Kali but defence has supplemented that\nthe entire consideration was paid by Ram Kali herself. Sale document has\nbeen proved as Ex. PW 126/4 (D-36). Sh. Rao has contended that during\ninvestigation, it surfaced that though the land had been purchased in the\nname of Ram Kali but the sale consideration was given by none other than\naccused persons.\n12.17        Such assertion, however, could not be substantiated during the\ntrial. Two independent witnesses PW-99 Chander Prakash and PW-111 Om\nPrakash have not supported the case of the prosecution. They both were\ncross-examined by the prosecution with permission of the court but they out-\nrightly denied that such land had been actually purchased by Ram Singh and\nthat the money was paid by Sh. Ram Singh. Though revenue record may\nindicate that the property was in the name of Ram Kali but the most important\nand vital aspect, as to who had paid the sale consideration, if not Ram Kali,\ncould not be proved in desired manner.\n12.18        Reference be also made to the testimony of PW-89 Raja Ram\nwho categorically deposed that he had sold such piece of land to Ram Kali by\nregistered sale deed. He also claimed that he did not know accused Ram\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 59 of 145\nSingh as he never met him. He was also cross-examined by the prosecution\nwith permission of court but he denied that the said land was purchased by\nRam Singh and that the sale consideration was paid by Ram Singh.\n12.19        In view of the aforesaid, the testimony of revenue officials\nincluding PW-41, PW-104, PW-115, PW-126 do not carry much significance.\n12.20        As per investigating agency, one more investment was made by\naccused persons in the name of Smt. Ram Kali vide serial No. 37 above and\na sum of Rs. 96,600/- was invested for seeking membership in Bhagwan\nBuddha Co-operative Society. Relevant documents are found contained in D-\n19, D-20 & D-38. These documents have not been admitted by defence and\nunfortunately, these documents have not been proved by the prosecution\neither. Therefore, such acquisition does not stand proved.\n12.21        Since, Ram kali had a separate identity and had means to\nsurvive and invest. She had applied for dealership in fertilizer and had\nagricultural income as well.        Since prosecution has not produced any\nsubstantial evidence to show to the contrary, said property is liable to be\nremoved from the assets - both at the start of check period and at the close\nof check period. For the same reasons, I also exclude the other properties\nand bank accounts from the relevant charts/Annexures.\nASSETS IN THE NAME OF JITENDER AND SAVITRI DEVI\n\n\n13.0         As regards property mentioned at serial no. 29 of Annexure-IV,\nthe same has been denied by the accused but it is very much evident that it\nwas acquired by accused in the name of their son Jitender Kumar Singh.\nOriginal application has been proved as Ex. PW 71/N (D-292). It bears the\nphotograph of Master Jitender Kumar Singh as he then was and the payment\nwas made in cash. Total consideration amount, given at the time of applying\nfor aforesaid property, was Rs. 17,000/- and the signatures of purported\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh            Page 60 of 145\napplicant i.e. Jitender Kumar are appearing at Q-558. However, as per\nspecific report of Dr. Ali given in Ex. PW 189/3, such signatures appearing at\nQ-558 matched with the admitted handwriting of accused Savitri Singh and,\ntherefore, such property is held to be acquired by accused only.\n13.1          It is also quite evident that Savitri Devi and Savitri Singh are\none and the same person. I have already referred about property mentioned\nat serial no. 10 of Annexure- IV. As per defence, Ramkali had a sister with\nsame name of Savitri Devi. When asked, it was revealed that name of her\nhusband was Ram Pal. No material has been brought on record to show that\nproperties alleged to be in the name of Savitri Devi are actually owned by\nsaid sister of Ram Kali.\n13.2          Reference be also made right here about the property\nmentioned at serial no. 2, i.e. Plot no. 261, Anand Kunj, Wazidpur, Dadri,\nGhaziabad. It had been purchased in the name of Savitri Devi. Accused has,\nhowever, denied any connection with the said property. According to her,\nSavitri Devi and Savitri Singh are two different entities and, therefore, such\nproperty cannot be attributed to her. Her such assertion is totally false and\nlame one. I have seen the application form which has been proved as Ex. PW\n50/C (D-2) and applicant has though described herself as Mrs. Savitri Devi\nbut the husband name has been proved as Sh. R. Singh which can be safely\nassumed to be Ram Singh. R. Singh would not denote Ram Pal at all. The\naddress has been mentioned as C-33, Sector-14, Noida which property is\none in the name of mother of accused Ram Singh Payment of Rs. 8,000/-\nwas made by way of cheque number 240078 dated 9.3.1989 drawn on\nCentral Bank of India, Khan Market branch, New Delhi which was owned by\naccused Savitri Singh. Statement of account of said bank account no. 3439\nhas been proved as Ex. PW 4/C (part of D-128). The documents related to\nsaid bank would clearly reveal that the account holder was Savitri Singh.\nThough the account opening form has not been brought on record, various\nentries mentioned in statement of account Ex. PW 4/C would indicate that\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 61 of 145\nsuch account was owned by Smt. Savitri Singh who was known as Savitri\nDevi before her marriage. From said account, payment has been made to\nDelhi Public School where her children were studying as well as to M/s\nChowdhary Estates and, therefore, she cannot be permitted to deny the fact\nthat she was the holder of said account bearing no. 3439 with Khan Market\nbranch of Central Bank of India and that she was the person who had applied\nfor the aforesaid acquisition.\n13.3          I would not mince any word in holding that even the property\nmentioned at serial no. 6 was stated to be purchased by accused Savitri\nSingh and she is trying to take undue advantage of the said fact of names.\nShe admitted that she was known as Savitri Devi before her marriage.\nMoreover, she was duly identified by PW-9 Rajpal, owner of the aforesaid\nproperty. He was the one who had sold the same to accused Savitri Singh.\nWhile identifying the relevant sale documents in the witness box, he also\npointed out towards both the accused claiming that they had come in relation\nto purchase of the said property. Though in later part of the deposition, he\nclaimed that the payment was not made by them but his testimony with\nrespect to the fact that the property was purchased by 'Savitri Singh'\nremained completely unimpeached and could not be dislodged by defence.\n13.4          As regards property mentioned at serial no. 20, as per\nallegations of CBI, such property was acquired by accused Savitri Singh in\nher own name and also in the name of Jitender Kumar Singh way back on\n11.6.1990. She had purchased the same from one Vinod Kumar s/o Sh. Jai\nRam and thereafter, such property was duly entered in their names in the\nrevenue record. Unfortunately, neither the concerned seller entered the\nwitness box nor the revenue record has been proved by anyone. I have seen\nthe documents contained in D-33 and since documents have not been\nproved in any manner whatsoever, such property is liable to be excluded\nfrom the present discussion.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh            Page 62 of 145\n13.5          Sh. Rao has asserted that prosecution may be given one more\nopportunity to summon the concerned official to prove the aforesaid\nacquisition. However, such request has come belatedly. Since even\notherwise, it is an old case, it is not possible to accede to such request.\n13.6          As regards property mentioned at serial no. 23 & 24 of\nAnnexure-IV, accused has denied having any concern with said property as\nwell as property mentioned at serial no. 25 & 26. However, testimony of\nPW126 Sh. Samta Prasad Srivastava belies her such assertion with respect\nto property mentioned at serial no. 23 & 24. He was posted as Sub Registrar,\nTehsil Kayamganj, District Farukhabad, UP and vide seizure memo Ex.\nPW126/1 (part of D-381), he had handed over attested copies of registered\nagreements/sale deeds to CBI.\n13.7          Ex. PW126/2 (D-34) is a certified copy of registered sale deed\nbetween Radhey Shyam and accused Savitri Singh which shows sale\nconsideration as Rs. 49,000/-. Another sale deed Ex. PW126/3 (D-35) shows\nthat Urmila wife of Radhey Krishan had sold the property to Jitender Singh\nson of Ram Singh and Sangeeta Singh daughter of Ram Singh for Rs.\n43,000/-. It seems that when such sale deeds were executed, stamp duty\nwas also borne by the vendee. However, such aspect has not been brought\non record very clearly and distinctly and thus there is no positive and specific\nevidence that such stamp duty was borne by vendee and vendee alone.\nTherefore, the acquisition cost is held as Rs. 49,000/- and Rs. 43,000/- for\nthe aforesaid two properties.\n13.8          As regards, property mentioned at serial no. 25, it seems that\nno witness has been examined to prove the aforesaid acquisition and no\ndocument has been exhibited either. As regards property mentioned at serial\nno. 26, though prosecution has examined PW111 Om Prakash to prove that\nhe had sold ¾ bigha of land for Rs. 10,000/- to accused Ram Singh and that\nland was transferred in the name of Savitri Singh, fact remains that he did not\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 63 of 145\nsupport the case of prosecution and rather claimed that he had sold the land\nof one bigha to Smt. Ram Kali. He also claimed that such transaction was\ncarried out by his uncle Subedar Singh who had received the sale\nconsideration from Ram Kali. He was also not confronted with any document\neither.\nOTHER ACCOUNTS\n\n\n14.0            Let me refer to now remaining bank accounts which are,\notherwise, not admitted by accused Savitri Singh.\n14.1            Let me take up the accounts held in Canara Bank, Munirka\nBranch.\n22.

According to prosecution, he also assisted the accused\npersons and benami account was opened and immovable property was\npurchased using his name. PW61 Puttu Lal has entered into witness box\nand as per his deposition, he was having agriculture land and was also\nearning handsomely from his tailoring business where he had employed\nthree-four employees. According to him, accused Ram Singh was son-in-law\nof his brother-in-law. He denied that he had given any loan of Rs. 40,000/- to\naccused Ram Singh while supplementing that he had given such loan to\nSmt. Ram Kali. He also pleaded his ignorance about receipt Ex. PW61/A\nand Ex. PW61/B.            Since he was not found supporting the case of\nprosecution, he was cross-examined by the prosecution with the permission\nof the Court and even during such cross-examination, he did not attribute any\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 64 of 145\ncriminality on the part of accused persons. He denied that Savitri Singh used\nto hold hand of her mother-in-law and used to get the documents signed from\nher and sometimes Savitri Singh herself used to sign in the name of her\nmother-in-law. He was man of means and such fact can be gauged by the\nsheer fact that even prosecution had suggested to him that he (Puttu Lal) had\nborne the cost of education on behalf of accused Ram Singh for nine years.\nHe denied that Sh. Pehlu Singh was extremely poor man and that he was in\nno position to bear the expenses of education. He admitted his signatures on\nvarious bank related documents but fact remains that with respect to alleged\naccount of Canara Bank, Munirka Branch, New Delhi, neither any question\nwas put to him nor he was shown any document. So much so, when PW29\nR. Niranjan, Sr. Manager, Munirka Branch entered into witness box, he also\ndid not make any reference about any document in relation to said bank\naccount of Sh. Puttu Lal. Similarly, PW77 P.M. Kushalappa, official of Canara\nBank, Munirka Branch, New Delhi has also not thrown any light with respect\nto the alleged account of Sh. Puttu Lal and, therefore, such account does not\nstand proved.\n14.3         Sh. Ram Prakash Singh was also having SB Account No. 1202\nwith said Branch and statement of account has been proved as Ex. PW29/H3\n(D-107) but except for the statement of account, nothing else has been\nshown which may even remotely indicate that it was benami account. Sh.\nRam Prakash Singh has also entered into witness box as DW2 and in his\nsuch deposition, he has categorically deposed in examination-in-chief that he\nwas having bank account no. 1202 in Canara Bank, Munirka Branch in which\nthere was last balance of Rs. 1,364/- in the year 1983. He also claimed that\napplication for opening of account Ex. PW29/H1 was bearing his signature\nand specimen card (Ex. PW29/H2) was having his signature. He claimed\nthat he was maintaining said account and various cheques were also signed\nby him in relation to said account.           His such deposition could not be\ndislodged by the prosecution and, therefore, said account is held as owned\nby Sh. Ram Prakash Singh in his right and capacity.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 65 of 145\n14.4           Accused Savitri Singh was also having joint account with his\nmother-in-law Smt. Ram Kali in said Branch. Documents contained in D-186\nto D-107 and same have been duly proved. Several cheques were also\nissued from said account under the sole signatures of accused Savitri Singh\nand Savitri Singh cannot be permitted to disown said bank account.\nAccordingly, said account his held as owned by accused Savitri Singh.\n14.5           Details of bank accounts mentioned at Sr. No. 59 & 60 of\nAnnexure-IV (b) are as under:-\n59.

P-824 (D-145), fact remains that neither PW28 Sanjeev Kapoor nor\nPW55 Sh. Anil Bhargava made any reference about said account. PW55 Sh.\nAnil Bhargava has, however, made reference about certified copy of ledger\naccount no. 11253 in the name of Sh. Ram Kali and has proved the same as\nEx. PW55/T (D-146) and specimen card of said account has also been\nproved as Ex. PW55/V and there is no cross-examination challenging the\naforesaid fact. However, since Smt. Ram Kali was having her own income,\nprosecution should have been brought some additional material to show that\nit was benami account and, therefore, I am constrained to hold that both the\naforesaid account mentioned at Sr. No. 59 & 60 do not stand proved.\n14.7           As per entry mentioned at Sr. No. 34 of Annexure-IV (b), Savitri\nSingh and Ram Kali were having joint account no. 17807 with South\nExtension Branch of Canara Bank. I have seen the testimony of two bank\nofficials i.e. PW167 Sh. Netra Pal Singh and PW173 Sh. K. Laxman Mallya.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                    Page 66 of 145\nExcept for proving the seizure memo regarding handing over of said\ndocuments and they have not said anything about the aforesaid account\nmuch less either it was a joint account or whether substantial banking activity\nhad been done by Savitri Singh. Account Opening Form (D-79) is also lying\nunproved and, therefore, entry mentioned at Sr. No. 34 does not stand\nproved.\n14.8         As regards bank account mentioned at Sr. No. 20 of Annexure-\nIV (b), accused Savitri Singh and Ram Kali were having joint account no.\n3361 with Central Bank of India, Noida. Admittedly, Ram Kali was registered\nowner of H. No. C-33, Sector-14, Noida and the account opening form has\nbeen proved as Ex. PW31/E and specimen card has been proved as Ex.\nPW31/F (D-427). I have seen two cheques issued from said bank account\nwhich have been proved as Ex. PW31/H1 & H2. These bear signatures of\nRam Kali at Q972 and Q974 respectively and even report of GEQD does not\ncome to the rescue of prosecution as these signatures allegedly of Ram Kali\ncould not be attributed to accused Savitri Singh. There is no other evidence\nwhich may indicate that it was actually a benami account exclusively held and\nmaintained by Savitri Singh and, therefore, said account is also excluded\nfrom the scope of the present consideration.\n14.9         As regards two bank accounts, mentioned at Sr. No. 9 & 12 of\nAnnexure-IV (b), maintained with Farukhabad Branch of Bank of India,\naccordingly to prosecution, Ram Kali was having Current Account No. 45 and\nRam Kali was also having another account jointly held with her son Ashok\nKumar Singh. Relevant documents are contained in D-120 to D-126. Except\nfor statement of account of said Current Account No. 45, which has been\nproved as Ex. PW83/6, nothing has been brought on record which may show\nthat it was a benami account. Even as regards other joint account no. 494,\nthere does not seem to be any document pertaining to said account at all\nand, therefore, both these accounts do not stand proved.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 67 of 145\n14.10         As per entry at Sr. No. 45 of Annexure-IV (b), Ram Kali and\nSavitri Singh were having joint account no. 91871 with PNB, Green Park,\nNew Delhi. Statement of account has been proved as Ex. PW67/H. Account\nopening form has been proved as Ex. PW67/C and various documents\nrelated to said account are contained in D-167 to D-173.          Sh. Rao has\nexpressed his surprise as to why Smt. Ram Kali, an aged lady who was even\notherwise illiterate, had opened so many accounts at so many places. He\nstates that therefore, burden shifts on to accused Savitri Singh to show that\nshe had no connection with the aforesaid account at all. It has also been\nargued that since account was maintained in Delhi, in all probabilities, it was\naccused Savitri Singh who was managing said account.\n14.11         Undoubtedly, such inference can be drawn but fact remains that\nexcept for the aforesaid inference, there is no other material which may show\nthat Ram Kali was not the joint holder. Since, I have already observed above\nthat Ram Kali was having her own separate identity and was having her own\nincome, without there being any further material, it will not be possible to hold\nthat it was a benami account held by accused Savitri Singh alone.\n14.12         As far as accounts mentioned at serial no. 46, 47, 48 & 51 of\nAnneuxre-IV (b) are concerned, relevant documents are contained in D-211 &\nD-212 and though these were admitted by accused Ram Singh during the\npendency of the matter, since outstanding balance was in said four accounts\nwas zero, it would make no difference if these accounts are excluded.\n14.13         As regards four accounts which accused Ram Singh was\nhaving with State Bank of India, Ballabh Bhawan, Bhopal, MP at Sr. No. 52 to\n55 of Annexure-IV (b), no witness has been examined by the prosecution.\nDocuments are contained in D-185 to D-196. Similarly, Ram Singh was\nhaving SB Account No. 8173 with UCO, Parliament Branch which is\nmentioned at Sr. No. 66 of Annexure-IV (b), the documents of which are\ncontained in D-176-D-178. These were admitted by accused Ram Singh\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 68 of 145\nduring the trial.   Fact, however, remains that no prosecution witness has\nentered into witness box for proving the said record and, therefore, in order to\neliminate any prejudice or grievance coming from the side of his wife, I am\nexcluding these accounts also.\n14.14         As far as details of various post office accounts as mentioned in\nAnnexure-IV (c) are concerned, these have been admitted by the accused.\nJEWALLARY, CASH & INDIRA VIKAS PATRAS (IVPS)\n\n\n15.0          According to CBI, the malafide intention on the part of accused\nstands exposed as when their lockers were searched, those were found\ncontaining unexplained and unaccounted jewellary articles, cash amount and\nIVPs. Besides aforesaid, these lockers were also found containing title deeds\nof properties held by accused in benami names as well as FDRs in benami\nnames. Sh. Rao has contended that all other relatives of the accused\npersons were living outside Delhi and there was no reason or occasion for\nthem to have handed over any such instrument, jewellary article or IVP to\naccused persons. It has been asserted by prosecution that finding no other\nplausible explanation, accused have tried to take shelter behind, evidently, a\nlame excuse by claiming that some such jewellary articles, IVPs and cash\nbelonged to their relatives and that due to some security concern, those were\ngiven to accused persons for keeping in locker in safe condition.\n15.1          Before discussing the aforesaid aspect, let me now first see as\nto what accused Savitri Singh has to say in this regard when she entered into\nwitness box as DW-8. Relevant portion of her deposition is extracted as\nunder:-\nJewellary:\n\"37     Settlements' regarding the distribution of the jewellery\n             has been declared in the Income -Tax assessment year 1992-\n93. My father-in-law and my mother-in-law made it to family\n             settlements regarding sharing of the jewellery in the family in\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 69 of 145\nnumerical 1977 and 1984. This partition has been declared by\nmy brother-in-law Sh Ram Avtar Singh, vide affidavit 31-7-96 to\nIT department. In the first partition, my children received 90\ntolas gold ornaments, 5 Kg Silver ornaments and utensils and\n100 silver coins. In 2nd Partition my children received 9 Tolas\ngold ornaments. During 1977 to 1984, my children received 15\ntolas gold ornaments and 15 silver coins on birthdays and other\noccasions. Total gold ornaments was 114 Tolas, 5 Kg silver\nornaments and utensils and 115 silver coins. I have sold Some\njewellery approx. 299 gms for children welfare trust for the\nbenefit of the children and the proceeds was deposited in the\naccount No. 3439, Central Bank Of India, Khan Market, New\nDelhi and Indian Bank, S.J Enclave, New Delhi and State Bank\nof Patiala, Palwal Haryana as per D-319, D-267 D-265 D-316.\nThe jewellery was also deposited in State bank of Patiala,\nPalwal, Haryana as per D-148 & D-331.\n38       During the investigation The valuation of the jewellery\n(D-383-387) was got done by M/s Khanna Brothers. The\nvaluation of the jewellery has been objected by me and\nvaluation report signed in protest. The claimants were not\ncalled at the time of the valuation of the jewellery. The slips of\nthe jewellery with the name of claimants were thrown by the\nCBI. The jewellery were kept in locker No. 29 at State bank of\nPatiala, Shastri Bhavan, Delhi and the locker No. 1035, in\nPunjab National Bank, Gulmohar Park, New Delhi. All the\njewellery were kept with me in my lockers. In 1972 my brother-\nin -law was kidnapped, other claimant had far flung areas of\nposting so the jewellery of the entire was kept with me.\n39        The personal gold jewellery of myself, which I received\nin marriage from my father and other relatives was around 25\ntola. I received from my father-in-law 20 tola gold jewellery,\nbefore marriage I had 3 tola gold jewellery, and received on\nvarious occasions 5 tola gold jewellery. Total, I have 53 tola\ngold jewellery. I have sold for Indira Puram plot scheme to M/s\nKhana jewellery on 29-4-90 for Rs 54,300/- (187.250 gms)\ndeposited in the account no. 1473, Bank of India, BZM, New\nDelhi. Intimation to the department has been given as per D-\n405 and D-8. After claiming the jewellery by the claimants, I\nwas left with the jewellery with me which I had kept in PNB\nLocker No.1035, Gulmohar Park, New Delhi. As per valuation\nReport dated 10-6-96 as per D-383, I have the following\njewellery:-\n(i)       Sr. No. 1, two set 4pcs each gold enabled and thread\n67.800gms\n(ii)      Sr. No.4, two set plain 4pcs and 3pcs gold 47.500gms\n(iii)     Sr. No. 5, one set plain 3 pcs gold 36.200gms\n(iv)      Sr. No. 8, 3 bracelet plain gold (Enamel) 56.100gms\n(v)       Sr. No. 9, 4 pair ear-rings and one ring with white\nstone (gold) 25.100gms\n(vi)      Sr. No.10, one pendant set 4pcs, two rings and small\npendant in gold and small diamond set (3.90cents) of 45gms.\nCBI Vs.

This is Before Check Period.\n15.2         It would also be import to take note of statements of other\ndefence witnesses.\n15.3         DW-1 Ashok Kumar Singh deposed in his examination-in-chief\nthat he had filed an application seeking release of the documents seized by\nCBI. He claimed that certain jewellary was seized by CBI which was kept by\nher mother Ram Kali for his marriage but fact remains that he could not give\nany further details of the same claiming that he did not remember the same.\nAs already noted, he has also categorically admittedthat he started earning\nfrom 1.4.1994 only. His testimony does not even remotely indicate that any\nsuch jewellary belonged to him or given to him by his mother had been kept\nin any locker by the accused. His vague assertion is totally meaningless.\n15.4         DW-2 Ram Prakash Singh has also not stated anything in this\nregard and he has not staked any claim over any article allegedly found in\nthe lockers. In his cross-examination, he, in a very casual manner, claimed\nthat he had kept some jewellary with accused Savitri Singh which contained\nof one gold chain, one pair tops, one pair baali, 8 bangles, 5 karas and one\nring. Surprisingly, he does not know even the weight of such ornaments. He\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 71 of 145\nclaimed that this jewellary was got prepared by his grandfather for his mother\nand after her death, same came in possession of Smt. Ram Kali. He is a\ngovernment official but fact remains that he never disclosed about such\njewellary articles to his own department.               No other document has been\nproduced by him to stake claim over such jewellary and it is quite evident that\nbeing a close relatives of accused Savitri Singh, he has attempted to bail her\nout by making a palpably wrong statement.\n15.5         The testimony of DW-4 Raj Kumari Singh rather demolishes the\ndefence as she has categorically claimed that she had not filed any objection\nbefore the court though objection petition was bearing her signatures.\nAccording to her she did not know as to who mentioned the facts contained\nin such objection petition. She claimed that she had not conveyed any such\nfact to anyone. Though she claimed that she was having one gold set and 4\nbangles which she had given to accused Savitri Singh but she has not given\nany further description about such gold articles. She has not apprised as to\nwhen such articles were handed over by her to accused Savitri Singh. Her\nhusband was a government employee and was posted in M. P. and it is\nunbelievable that she would hand over her such few jewellary articles to\naccused Savitri Singh in Delhi claiming that her area was not safe.\n15.6         DW-6 Kusum Lata has also deposed that she had kept some of\nher jewellary with accused Savitri Singh as she did not have any locker.\nShe, however, also claimed that she was not aware as to where those\njewellary articles were kept by accused Savitri Singh. According to her, when\nshe demanded her jewellary back from accused Savitri Singh, it was told that\nsuch jewellary had been seized in the present matter. In her cross-\nexamination, she admitted that her husband was working as Deputy Regional\nMarketing Officer and remained posted in various cities. Her husband had\neven taken a Government accommodation in Oria in 1990-91 and she hardly\nused to visit Delhi once or twice a year and it is not worth-imagining that she\nwould hand over her jewellary articles to accused Savitri Singh for alleged\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                    Page 72 of 145\nsafe custody. She could have easily taken a locker in the bank situated in the\ncity where her husband remained posted but for totally explicable reasons,\nshe did not apply for any such locker. So much so, she does not even know\nweight or value of such jewellary articles and baldly claimed that these were\ngiven to her by her-in-laws.\n15.7          DW-7 Jitender Kumar Singh has defended his mother by\nclaiming that he too had received some jewellary articles, from time to time,\non several occasions, i.e. on his birthdays, functions, ceremonies etc. He\nhas not thrown any light whether he himself had any locker in his name or\nnot. According to him, most of the jewellary seized by CBI was gifted to him\nby his grandparents but he failed to give further details as to who gifted and\nwhen.\n15.8          Thus, the cumulative reading of such defence witnesses clearly\ngoes on indicate that they have merely tried to help accused Savitri Singh. I\nhave no hesitation in holding that all the jewellary articles, IVPs and cash,\nwhich were eventually recovered from the lockers search, belonged to\naccused persons only.\n15.9          As regards IVPs, accused has baldly claimed that she owned\nIVPs worth Rs. 11,000/- only. Her such assertion is not believable.\n15.10         Let me now come to the lockers held by accused Savitri Singh.\nShe had locker no. 270, Moti Bagh branch, U.B.I. and she also had one\nlocker no. 400, Safdarjung Enclave Development Area branch of Indian\nBank. These two lockers were searched on 28.4.1992 and 20.5.1992\nrespectively. Observation memos have been proved as Ex. PW 132/1 and\nEx. PW 15/B respectively and both these lockers were found empty at the\ntime of search.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 73 of 145\n15.11        Accused Savitri Singh was having two lockers in Green Park\nbranch of PNB. These were having locker no. 1035 and locker no. 907. Both\nthese lockers were searched on 27.4.1992. However, when locker no. 1035\nwas searched, it was found empty as is evident from observation memo Ex.\nPW 168/2. However, locker no. 907 was got drilled opened at the request of\naccused Savitri Singh, who claimed that she had misplaced her             keys.\nAccordingly, a service mechanic was arranged who drilled open the locker\nand then inventory was prepared. Right here, I would also like to mention\nhere that gold jewellary and silver coins which were recovered from locker\nno. 907 were eventually put in locker no. 1035 same day and thereafter both\nthe said lockers were sealed. Search of locker no. 907 led to the following\nrecovery:-\n(i) Gold Jewellary (1020 grams).\n(ii) Silver Coins (100 grams.)\n(iii) Cash Rs. 50,000/-\n(iv) Bunch of IVPs\n\n\n15.12         Besides the aforesaid, various FDRs, passbooks and other title\ndeeds were recovered which are described in search-cum-seizure memo Ex.\nPW 168/1.\n15.13        Accused Savitri Singh was also having locker no. 139 with\nMunirka branch of OBC. It was also searched on 25.4.1992 and memo in this\nregard has been proved as Ex. PW 143/1. It was also found containing,\ninter-alia, cash amount of Rs. 1928/-, gold ornaments and silver ornaments.\nThe weight of the gold ornaments was found to be 150 grams and weight of\nsilver ornaments was found to be 1450 grams. These were resealed by\nplacing those in the same locker.\n15.14        Accused Savitri Singh had another locker, i.e. locker no. 29,\nShastri Bhawan branch of State Bank of Patiala. It was searched on\n25.4.1992 and it was found containing, inter-alia, cash of Rs. 1,00,950/-,\nvarious FDRs, sale deeds/title deeds and various jewellary articles.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 74 of 145\n15.15        Though the lockers had been searched in the year 1992, the\ninvestigating agency got the valuation report prepared much later, i.e. on\n10.6.1996.\n15.16        Let me see these valuation reports.\n15.17        Valuation report Ex. PW 56/A (part of D-383) indicates that\nworth of jewellary articles found during the locker search of PNB Green Park\nBranch was Rs. 4,04,684/-. The concerned valuer also certified that the\nvaluation was based on the market value as on 13.4.1992. Ex. PW 56/B is in\nrespect of the jewellary articles found in the locker no. 139 of OBC, Munirka\nBranch and the worth of jewellary was found to be of Rs. 62,919/-. Valuation\nreport Ex. PW 56/C pertains to articles recovered from locker of State Bank\nof Patiala, Shastri Bhawan and total worth of such articles was found to be\nRs. 7,16,791/-.\n15.18        Accused Savitri Singh has opposed the manner of valuation.\nShe has claimed that these jewellary, as contained in locker no. 139 of OBC\nMunirka branch, belonged to Kusum Dass and she was not called by CBI\ndespite her request. She also went on to indicate that there was a slip on the\njewellary articles which also suggested that these belonged to Kusum Dass.\nShe claimed to have signed the valuation reports under protest.\n15.19        I have seen the testimony of all concerned search witnesses as\nwell as valuer and neither the search operation nor the valuation reports\ncould be impeached by the defence in any manner whatsoever. I have seen\ntestimony of PW-60 Prem Nath Khanna, approved Government valuer who\nhas proved his valuation reports. He also clarified in cross-examination that\nhe had prepared the valuation report on the basis of prevalent market rate. It,\nhowever, seems that what he wanted to indicate could not be recorded\nproperly as in all reports, he has very specifically claimed that the market\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 75 of 145\nvalue was taken as on 17.4.1992.\n15.20        PW-56 Sh. J.K. Gogia was posted as Inspector in the office of\nCommissioner of Income Tax-I and he was joined as attesting witness at the\ntime of such valuation and he has supported the case of prosecution and\nnothing stands revealed in his cross-examination which may indicate that the\nvaluation was improper.       Testimony of concerned bank officials clearly\nindicates that the lockers were searched in the proper manner. Moreover,\nthere is no defence that any article was planted in the locker or that the\nobservation memos were not prepared as per the articles contained in the\nlockers.\n15.21        According to Annexure-IV, accused were having total cash of\nRs. 1,90,848/- and jewellery worth Rs. 11,84,394/- as on the close of check\nperiod. Said calculation seems to have been done on the basis of following\ndetails:\n15.22        Recovery of cash: (I) Cash Rs. 29,320/- recovered as per Ex.\nPW18/A from house search of D-II/3, Andrews Ganj dated 14.04.1992.

Weight of various jewellery articles has been\nmentioned and value has not been given except for three articles whose\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 76 of 145\nvalue has been assessed as Rs. 7,225/-. (ii) Jewellery articles recovered\nfrom locker no. 29 State Bank of Patiala, Shastri Bhawan New Delhi vide\nmemo Ex. PW142/1. Valuation of all such jewellery articles was got done\nand as per memo Ex. PW56/C (D-383), the value has been found to be Rs.\n7,16,791/-. (iii) Gold ornaments (150 grams) and silver ornaments (1450\ngrams) from locker no. 139 OBC Munirka Branch vide memo Ex. PW143/1.\nValuation of all such jewellery articles was got done and as per memo Ex.\nPW56/B (D-383), the value has been found to be Rs. 62,919/-. (iv) Gold\njewellery (1020 grams) and silver coins (100 grams) from locker no. 907,\nPNB Green Park Branch, New Delhi vide memo Ex. PW168/1. Valuation of\nall such jewellery articles was got done and as per memo Ex. PW56/A (D-\n383), the value has been found to be Rs. 4,04,684/-.\n15.24         There does not seem to be any dispute with respect to the\nrecovery of cash and it is not possible that even cash would be of other\nrelatives of accused persons.\n15.25         Accused Savitri Singh has merely owned up some of the\narticles lying in locker of PNB. However, I have no hesitation in holding that\nall such articles were owned by accused persons and there was no reason or\noccasion for any of her relative to have kept their jewellery in the locker of\naccused persons without any reason much less a plausible one. As regards\njewellery articles, Sh. Singh has, as already noted, claimed that valuation has\nnot been done properly. I have seen the valuation reports and the gold value\nhas been taken as it was prevalent on 13.04.1992. However, still, it has not\nbeen specified whether value has been taken as per 22 carats or 24 carats.\nDefence is also to be equally blamed as it also did not try to seek clarification\nregarding said aspect either during the cross-examination of prosecution\nwitnesses or during its own evidence. However, ends of justice would meet if\nmargin of 10 per cent is given to accused and accordingly, worth of jewellery\narticles is held as Rs. 10,65,954.60 instead of Rs. 11,84,394/.\nCBI Vs.

Intimation to the Income tax department has been\n            given as per D-38.\n16.3         Thus, if her investment in shares of Bindal Agro Chemical\nLimited, FSL, Garden Silk, Hindustan Development Corporation, J.K.\nSynthetic, Electro Steel, Finolex, Grasim, Reliance Petro Chemicals, Steel\nStrips and Usha is calculated, even as per her, it comes to Rs. 42,775/-.\nAccording to her, shares of Goodrich were obtained prior to the check period\nand shares of Reliance Industries came to her on the basis of conversion on\nright basis and 240 shares of L&T came to her from the estate of her father,\ntherefore, these could not have been taken into consideration.\n16.4         In order to prove holding of shares as well as income by way of\ninterest/dividend, several witnesses have entered into witness box from the\nside of prosecution. Let me deal with their evidence one by one.\n(1) Electrosteel Castings Ltd: I have seen testimony of PW-\n178 Nalin Baijal which goes on to indicate that such investment was made in\nthe year 1989 and Rs. 1700/- each was deposited by accused Savitri Singh\nand Sh. Jitender Kumar Singh. Such evidence is unchallenged.\n(2) Finolex Pipes Ltd: PW-179 Sh. Kartikey B. Dave has\nentered into witness box and has proved details as contained in letter Ex. PW\n179/2 (D-220). According to such details, each of the four allottees had\ndeposited a sum of Rs. 3750/- during the period 22.9.1990 to 5.2.1992. I\nhave seen such letter as well as details contained therein and there is no\ncross-examination with respect to said aspect either.\n(3) Reliance Industries Ltd: Reference be made to the\ntestimony of PW-180 Sh. Rohit Channalal Shah. He has deposed that Ram\nSingh and Savitri Singh had invested a sum of Rs. 2,000/- in September,\n1985 but out of the said amount Rs. 1037.80 was refunded on 7.10.1985.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 84 of 145\nThis reduces the actual investment to Rs. 962/-. PW-180 Sh. Rohit Shah also\nadmitted in his examination-in-chief itself that he was not in a position to give\nthe date and year of any other investment.\n(4) Larsen & Toubro Ltd: PW-181 Sanjay Laxman Mali, on the\nbasis of letter Ex. PW 181/1 (D-229), has deposed that accused Savitri Singh\nhad invested a sum of Rs. 29,280/ on 13.10.1986 and applied for 244 shares.\nHe has also deposed about the investment made by accused Savitri Singh,\ni.e. investment of Rs. 2500/- (for 25 debentures), Rs. 5,000/- (for 40\ndebentures), Rs. 40,500/- (for 50 debentures) and Rs. 6,000/- (for 20\ndebentures). He also deposed that Ram Singh had invested Rs. 9,000/- (for\n30 debentures). Thus, the total investment with respect to shares of Larsen &\nToubro Ltd. comes to Rs. 92,280/- (Rs. 83280/- plus 9,000/-).\n(5) Food Specialties Ltd: In order to prove investment made\nfor acquisition of said company, prosecution has examined PW-182 Rajinder\nAgarwal. He has deposed that accused Ram Singh had invested Rs. 3040/-\nfor purchase of 19 convertible debentures of Rs. 160/- each on 14.4.1988. He\nalso proved allotment certificate as well as bonus share certificates. He has\nalso deposed that Savitri Singh had invested Rs. 4,000/- their company and\naccordingly she was allotted 25 debentures on 14.4.1988. Thus, total\ninvestment on behalf of both the accused, in view of the aforesaid testimony\nof sh. Agarwal, comes to Rs. 7040/-.\n(6) Steel Strips: PW-185 Sh. M.L. Jain has entered into\nwitness box and has deposed that vide letter Ex. PW 185/1 (D-236), details\nregarding debentures in the name of Smt. Ram Kali, Jitender Kumar Singh\nand accused Savitri Singh were provided. I have carefully perused Ex. PW\n185/1 (D-236) and the chart attached with the same. It seems that 75 shares\nwere applied by Savitri Devi and same number of shares was applied for by\nRam Kali and Jitender Kumar Singh and they were allotted 25 shares each\non 19.1.1991. Remaining 50 shares were allotted to both of them beyond the\ncheck period. It also seems that when the applications were moved by\napplicants, they had made the payment at the rate of Rs. 105/- per debenture\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 85 of 145\nfor 50 debentures each. Thus, total investment by Savitri Singh was of Rs.\n5250/-. Similarly the total investment/deposit made by Ram Kali/Jitender\nKumar Singh was also of Rs. 5250/-.\n(7) Grasim Industries Ltd: PW-198 Pankaj Kapdeo has proved\nhis letter Ex. PW 190/4 whereby he had provided information regarding\ninvestment made by Ram Singh, Savitri Singh, Raj Kumar Singh in shares\nand debentures. There is no challenge to his such testimony. I have also\nseen the relevant document i.e. D-221. I have seen the details annexed with\nthe said letter and though it is apparent that investment had been made by\nSh. Ram Singh, Savitri Singh and Raj Kumari Singh for obtaining shares of\nM/s Grasim but even as per details certified by M/s Grasim Industries Ltd.,\nparticulars regarding payments were not available with the company. Some of\nthe shares were allotted in the year 1982 and in 1983 which are naturally\nbefore the check period. Bonus shares were also allotted but such allotment\ncannot be reckoned for the present purpose. Said chart also discloses that\nsome shares were given against the conversion. Be that as it may, the chart\ndoes not convey a very clear picture about the exact date of investment and\neven the testimony of PW-198 Sh. Pankaj Kapdeo, Deputy Company\nSecretary with M/s Grasim Industries Ltd. does not throw requisite light and\nsince wild guess or estimation would not be permissible, the worth of\nacquisition does not stand proved in the desired manner.\n(8) J.K. Synthetics: On careful perusal of the details contained\nin Ex. PW 169/2 (D-227), it is quite clear that there was total investment of\nRs. 6300/- on behalf of accused Savitri Singh for acquiring shares which also\nincluded investment of Rs. 1500/- on behalf of Ram Kali as well.\n(9) M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd: As regards holding which accused\nRam Singh and his son Jitender Kumar Singh had with M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd.,\nPW-176 P. N. Wahal has graced the witness box and has proved his letter Ex.\nPW 176/8 (D-215). This letter clearly proves that Ram Singh and Jitender\nKumar Singh were allotted 25 partly convertible debentures and they both\nhad invested Rs. 3500/- each in their company in the year 1989. The\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 86 of 145\ntestimony of Sh. Wahal remains unrebutted and the record proved brought\nhim also shows the acquisition as alleged by the prosecution.\n(10) Bindal Agro Chemcals Ltd: Sh. A. K. Rao, Ld. Sr. PP\nhas, though, very fairly admitted that no concerned official of M/s Bindal Agro\nChemicals Ltd. has graced the witness box, yet the bank record establishes\nthat Savitri Singh had made total payment of Rs. 2500/- to said company in\nrelation to her such holding. Reference has been made to two cheques Ex.\nPW 42/O and Ex. PW 42/P. These two cheques are dated 19.10.1989 and\n6.2.1990 respectively and are of Rs. 1250/- each.        I have also seen the\ntestimony of PW-42 Sh. N. K. Madan who has proved the relevant bank\ndocuments including the aforesaid two cheques and such fact could not be\ndislodged by the defence during the cross-examination or otherwise. Thus,\nacquisition, to that effect, is held as proved.\n16.5          Undoubtedly, some of the share holdings could not be proved\nby the prosecution. As already noticed above, number of share holdings\nhave been admitted by accused Savitri Singh in her defence evidence itself\nand it is settled position of law that a fact admitted need not be proved any\nfurther and, therefore, on cumulative reading of evidence adduced during the\ntrial as well as the admission by the defence, the acquisition with respect to\nshare holdings stands proved as Rs. 163682/-.\nHOUSE SEARCH\n\n17.0          It is now appropriate to see the aspect related to house search.\n17.1          Inventories were prepared during the various house searches.\nAs per the prosecution case, accused were having household articles at the\nstart of check period to the tune of Rs. 87,275/- and such worth escalated to\nRs. 4,44,008/- at the time of end of check period.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 87 of 145\n17.2            According to Sh. M.P. Singh, learned defence counsel, house of\nNoida is required to be excluded as it belonged to Smt. Ram Kali and her\nbelongings cannot be held to be the assets of accused persons. As regards\nvaluation conducted with respect to household goods of Delhi house, Sh.\nM.P. Singh has contended that CBI has overvalued most of the household\narticles and even the acquisition year has been mentioned incorrectly. He\nhas also claimed that most of such articles were, even otherwise, of pre-\ncheck period.\n17.3            Let me first come straightway to house search related to Noida\nhouse which has been proved as Ex. PW31/J. It is important to mention that\neven as per the observation memo Ex. PW31/J, when the search was\nconducted, house was found locked and nobody was found present in the\nhouse. However, Ram Singh was already accompanying the raiding party\nand the lock was broken with his consent and then all the articles lying in the\nhouse were noted down and the cost of the articles was assessed. Reference\nbe made to the testimony of PW31 Sh. V.K. Aggarwal.           He was, at the\nrelevant time, posted in Central Bank of India and knew the accused family\nalso. Besides proving the bank record pertaining to Sh. Ashok Kr. Singh,\nSmt. Ram Kali and Savitri Singh, he also deposed that on 28.04.1992, he\nalong with CBI team had gone to house located at C-33, Sector-14, Noida.\nHouse was found locked and same was broken in the presence of Sh. Ram\nSingh and the articles kept/found there were noted down in the observation\nmemo. He also claimed that he signed the observation along with CBI team\nand date of acquisition and mode of acquisition and amount written against\neach item was mentioned in the observation memo on the basis of revelation\nmade by Sh. Ram Singh. Fact, however, remains that it has already been\ndiscussed above that said house belonged to Smt. Ram Kali and since she\nwas having a separate and independent entity, of her own, it will not be\nappropriate to fasten her household articles upon the accused persons. As\nper rough calculation, worth of such assets is found to be around Rs.\n80,000/-.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 88 of 145\n17.4         Significant recovery is from H. No. D-II/3, Andrews Ganj, New\nDelhi.   It will be important to mention right here that such house was\nsearched twice by CBI.        First search took place on 14.04.1992 when a\ndetailed inventory was made with respect to the household articles. It also\ncomprises of observation memo showing the valuation of all such assets. It\nalso takes into consideration the Fiat Car worth Rs. 52,000/- and cash worth\nRs. 29,300/-. Besides the aforesaid, various jewellery articles were found\nlying in the house.     These were evaluated on approximation basis and\nthereafter such jewellery was returned back to Sh. Ram Singh. No such\njewellery was taken into possession by CBI.\n17.5         Another search of said house was conducted on 20.04.1992\nand then CBI learnt that certain items of jewellery, which they had observed\nduring the earlier search, were missing on the comparison of list prepared on\n13.04.1992. Fact remains that no such list dated 13.04.1992 of jewellery\narticles is found to be on record or proved by the prosecution. Thereafter,\ninvestigating officer took the remaining jewellery articles to a goldsmith M/s\nDhir Sons, Greater Kailash, New Delhi. Inventory was prepared. Search\nmemo has been proved as Ex. PW183/1 and memo prepared at M/s Dhir\nSons has been proved as Ex. PW183/2. I have seen the testimony of PW183\nSh. P.K. Dass, official of Oriental Bank of Commerce. He was briefed that a\nraiding team had been constituted in which he was to join as a witness and\nthen they reached H. No. D-II/3, Andrews Ganj, New Delhi. He deposed that\nsearch-cum-seizure memo was prepared in his presence and he signed on\neach page of such memo. He has also deposed about preparation of\nobservation memo. In his cross-examination, he also claimed that there were\ntwo independent witnesses and six-seven CBI officials when they reached at\nthe spot. He deposed that neighbours were not joined in the raid. Though\nhis examination seems to be little sketchy but fact remains that defence could\nnot dig out anything substantial from his cross-examination either.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 89 of 145\n17.6          PW183 Sh. Lalit Mohan was posted as Clerk in Corporation\nBank, CGO, New Delhi. He joined search operation dated 20.04.1992. He\nhas deposed that he accompanied CBI team to a flat having number as. D-3\nprobably and CBI had prepared list of articles found during the search of said\nflat.   He has also deposed that search memo Ex. PW183/1 (D-382) was\nbearing his signatures. He also deposed that after conducting search, they\nall went to a jewellery shop situated at Greater Kailash for weighing the\njewellery articles found during the search. Thereafter, a list was got prepared\nat the jewellery shop. He also signed the same. He has also proved the\nappraisal list EX. PW183/2.        His cross-examination also does not show\nanything worth mentioning.\n17.7          With the assistance of Sh. Rao, valuation of household articles\nas recovered in the search of H. No. D-II/3, Andrews Ganj has been\ncalculated and total worth comes to Rs. 3.50 lacs approximately. Though\nvaluation does not seem to be on higher side or exaggerated one but still, to\nbe fair to the accused, I grant further benefit of 10 per cent to her and,\ntherefore, worth is held as Rs. 2.80 lacs. Right here, I would also add that to\navoid double jeopardy, I am not reckoning the cost of car as part of assets\nsince cost thereof is mentioned in expenditure chart.\n17.8          Defence has not been able to show as to what assets, which\nthey actually possessed at the start of check period, have been omitted by\nthe investigating agency and, therefore, the initial figure worth of assets taken\nas Rs. 82,275/- is also treated in the same manner by giving benefit of 10 per\ncent and such worth is held as Rs. 78,547.\nEXPENDITURE\n\n\n18.0          As regards item no. 1, according to CBI, accused had paid\nhouse tax for his house No. E-7/717, Shahpura, Bhopal, MP @ Rs. 830/- per\nannum. According to CBI, during the check period, he had paid a sum of Rs.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 90 of 145\n4,150/- towards house tax. In this regard, prosecution has relied upon the\ntestimony of PW59 Sh. P.C. Patil who used to work as LDC in the Office of\nMunicipal Corporation, Shivaji Nagar, Bhopal. He has made reference about\nthe relevant documents contained in D-66 and deposed that as per record,\ntotal house tax paid by accused Ram Singh was Rs. 4,150/-. He has also\nmade reference to the payments made by accused Ram Singh with respect\nto some such receipts and also deposed that entries in those receipts had\nbeen made by him in the official record. Such official record has been proved\nas Ex. PW59/A.      There is no suggestion to the contrary.        It was never\nsuggested to Sh. Patil that no such house tax was paid by Sh. Ram Singh\nand, therefore, for all practical purpose, such expenditure, particularly in light\nof convincing testimony of PW59 Sh. P.C. Patil stands proved.\n18.1          As regards items mentioned at serial no. 2 & 3 of Annexure III,\nreference be made to the statement of account of Bhopal Co-operative\nCentral Government Bank Ltd. Such statement is contained in D-204 and\nhas been proved as Ex. P-1000. Such statement clearly indicates that total\nsum of Rs. 50,000/- was disbursed to accused Ram Singh. It also becomes\nclear that he repaid the same with interest of Rs. 14,376/-. Moreover, such\nexpenditure has to be read along with the income from known sources during\nthe check period and prosecution has already taken into consideration said\nloan amount of Rs. 50,000/- at entry no. 15 of Annexure-II as income details.\nSaid entries thus stand proved.\n18.2          As regards expenditure item mentioned at serial no. 4 related to\nground-rent of Bhopal house, though some of the relevant documents are\nfound to be admitted and have been exhibited as Ex. P-1086 to P-1132 but\nthese documents are in relation to execution of lease deed only. Admittedly,\nsuch lease deed bears stipulation regarding the payment of ground rent but\nmerely because a recital to that effect is there in the lease deed would not\nautomatically mean that ground rent was also paid much less that such\npayment was made within the check period. Therefore, such entry does not\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 91 of 145\nstand substantiated in the desired manner.\n18.3         As regards item no. 5, as per prosecution case, accused had\nmade expenditure towards payment of ground rent for their Munirka House.\nIn this regard, CBI has examined PW39 Sh. S.K. Singhal who was posted as\nSenior Account Officer, DDA, Vikas Sadan at the relevant time. He deposed\nthat the property in question i.e. Flat No. BH-10B, Munirka had been allotted\nto Ms. Savitri Singh and besides making of payments of EMIs regarding cost\nof the flat, allottee had also paid ground rent @ Rs. 270/- per annum. Total\nground rent paid by Ms. Savitri Singh between the period 01.01.1982 to\n11.11.1992 has been proved as Rs. 3,330/-. Since the check period is from\n01.01.1985 to 13.04.1992, the ground rent for the check period (8 years) has\nbeen taken by the prosecution as Rs. 2,160/-. Testimony of PW39 Sh. S.K.\nSinghal could not be impeached by the defence in any manner whatsoever\nand the relevant documents contained in D-31, which stand duly proved,\nconfirms the aforesaid expenditure.\n18.4         No witness has been examined to prove the expenditure\nmentioned at Sr. No. 6.\n18.5         As regards National Saving Certificate (NSC) dated 14.02.1989\nmentioned at serial no.7, prosecution has relied upon the testimony of\nPW159 Sh. S.R. Dhudhe as well as upon the testimony of PW187 Sh. R.K.\nSingh. They both are officials of Post Office. PW159 Sh. S.R. Dhudhe was\nposted as Assistant Post Master, Chhindwara Post Office, MP and he has\ndeposed that vide letter Ex. PW159/1 (D-53), he had furnished information to\nCBI regarding NSCs issued from Chhindwara Post Office in the name of Ram\nSingh. He has deposed that such information was provided on the basis of\nrecord of post office. Similarly, PW187 Sh. R.K. Singh has deposed about\nvarious National Saving Certificates which had been issued by the Post\nOffice, Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi. It will be also important to mention that\nseveral such NSCs were admitted by the accused during the trial. Accused\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 92 of 145\nSavitri Singh had also admitted some of the NSCs contained in D-379. Three\nNational Saving Certificates in question i.e. Ex. P-1198 to Ex. P-1200 have\nnot been admitted by accused Savitri Singh herself but fact remains that\nPW187 R.K. Singh has categorically deposed about all these three NSCs as\nwell and has testified that these were issued by Post Office of Krishi Bhawan,\nNew Delhi and were bearing stamp of their post office. These were issued on\n14.03.1989. Two certificates are of face value of Rs. 1,000/- each and one is\nof Rs. 500/-. Thus, the total investment comes to Rs. 2,500/-. Same stands\nproved.\n18.6          Besides the expenditure mentioned at item no. 8, 9 & 10 for\nULIP of Unit Trust of India (UTI), CBI has also made reference about UTI in\nthe charts of assets as well as of the income. It will be appropriate if all these\nentries are taken up together. Numbers of witnesses have been examined by\nthe prosecution in this regard.     Reference be also made to the testimony of\nPW32, PW37, PW53, PW184, PW186, PW193 & PW194.\n18.7          PW32 Ms. Bindu Khanna had the agency of UTI and she has\nproved the application form of Master Equity Plan 1992. According to her,\nsuch form (Ex. PW32/A) was in relation to purchase of 1000 Master Equity\nPlan Units of Scheme MEP-92. Application was filled up by Ram Singh who\nhad signed the form in her presence. Nominee was Savitri Singh and\naccording to her, payment for above said 1000 units was made by way of\ncheque dated 24.01.1992 drawn on SBI for Rs. 10,000/-.\n18.8          PW32 Ms. Bindu Khanna has also made reference about the\ninvestment made by accused Ram Singh in UGS 2000 Scheme. He invested\nRs. 2,000/- in his own name and purchased the Units under the same\nscheme in the name of his daughter Sangeeta Bala Singh and such payment\nwas made by accused Ram Singh in cash. She has further deposed that\nRam Singh has also purchased units in ULIP 1971 Scheme for Rs. 2,000/- in\nthe name of his wife Savitri Singh and the payment was made by Ram Singh\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 93 of 145\nin cash.   However, in her deposition, she nowhere verified whether such\ninvestment/payment was made by Ram Singh during the check period or not.\nShe also did not make any reference about any document and, therefore, the\naforesaid alleged investment of Rs. 6,000/- (Rs. 4000 in USG 2000 Scheme\nand Rs. 2,000 in ULIP 1971 Scheme) does not stand proved.\n18.9         PW37 Naresh Kr. Sachdeva of Tata Consultancy made\nreference about one letter dated 26.03.1995 which was written to CBI by Sh.\nB.N. Krishna. Such letter has been proved by him as Ex. PW37/A. He, on\nthe basis of such letter, made reference about the transactions and details of\nunits applied by Ram Singh and his wife till 13.04.1992. Transactions details\nhave been given in Ex. PW37/B (part of D-239). Such chart clearly indicates\nthat a total sum of Rs. 6,000/- was invested by accused Ram Singh for\npurchasing Units and he made payment through SBI, DMS Shadipur, New\nDelhi Branch. Similarly, Savitri Singh also paid a sum of Rs. 2,000/- through\ncheque drawn on her OBC Munirka Branch, New Delhi account. All such\ncheques are also dated 10.09.1990.\n18.10        Testimony of PW53 Rajinder Kumar does not seem to be of\nmuch significance as he has merely identified the signatures of Sh. Rajender\nSingh, the then Deputy Manager, UTI on letter Ex. PW53/A. He did not make\nany mention about the investment or other details related to accused\npersons. I have seen Ex. PW53/A (D-245). It also only talks about the name\nof the holder of the units and about the number of units held by such holders\ni.e. Savitri Singh and her children but there are no other details with respect\nto the date of purchase of units and the mode of acquisition. Therefore, the\ntestimony of PW53 Rajinder Kumar does not take us anywhere.\n18.11        I have also seen the testimony of PW184 Mahadev and PW186\nSh. P.S. Narula. They both are officials of UTI and their testimony would\nmerely indicate that Savitri Singh had made investment of Rs. 500/- for\npurchasing units in the name of her child Kumari Sangeeta Bala Singh. Such\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 94 of 145\ninvestment was made on 02.03.1977 even as per testimony of PW184. I\nhave seen letter Ex. PW184/1 (D-243) and it becomes evident that such\ninvestment was of the year 1977 i.e. much prior to the check period in\nquestion and, therefore, their testimony also does not carry any real value in\nrelation to the present acquisition.\n18.12         Testimony of PW193 Sh. Asik Pramanik is also little bit\nskeptical. He claimed that he did not remember whether CBI had made any\ninquiry from him in connection with the present case. He was shown letter\ndated 30.09.1994 signed by Mr. Jaggi who was posted as AGM with UTI at\nthe relevant time. He identified his signatures and on the strength of such\nletter Ex. PW193/1 (D-244), he deposed that dividend was paid to accused\nRam Singh.     Prosecution, at the time of recording of deposition of said\nwitness, did not make any endeavour to decipher the exact payment of\ndividend. However, keeping in mind the check period, it becomes clear that\nSh. Ram Singh was paid dividend of Rs. 770/- (Rs. 160 + 165 + 195 + 250)\nduring the check period.\n18.13         PW194 Gurdeep Singh Kochhar has made reference about\nletter Ex. PW194/1 (D-240). As per said letter, Sh. Ram Singh had taken\nULIP policy on 01.10.1984 and the date of maturity was 10.10.1994 and the\nannual contribution was to be of Rs. 1,200/-. Similarly, Savitri Singh joined\nULIP policy on 01.07.1984 having maturity as 01.07.1994 and her annual\ncontribution was also of Rs. 1,200/-. It seems that prosecution calculated the\nexpenditure towards acquiring ULIP policy on the basis of fact that accused\npersons were required to pay annual contribution @ Rs. 1,200/-. There is\nevery possibility that they must have paid the contribution and must have\nbeen issued certificates thereafter only but fact remains that even as per\nletter Ex. PW194/1 (D-240), UTI has expressed its inability to furnish the\ndetails and mode of payment of yearly contribution. It was only able to give\none detail of payment of Rs. 1,200/- through cheque dated 06.03.1991. Mere\nassumption and guess work would not work and, therefore, investment\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 95 of 145\nstands proved only to the extent of Rs. 1,200/-.\n18.14         Net result of my aforesaid discussion goes on to show that as\nregards items no. 8, 9 & 10 of Annexure-III, though total expenditure alleged\nto have been made by accused was to the tune of Rs. 22,800/- but same\nstands proved to the extent of Rs. 1,200/- only. I am mindful of the fact that\nprosecution has brought on record additional expenditure/investment of Rs.\n18,000/- during the check period but fact remains that such investment/\nexpenditure was never taken into consideration during the investigation and,\ntherefore, expenditure chart cannot be changed at the fag end of the case\nand, that too, to the prejudice of the accused and, therefore, I am not\nconsidering the aforesaid investment of Rs. 18,000/- which though seems to\nhave been made by accused during check period established in view of the\nafore-referred testimony of prosecution witnesses.\n18.15         It would be also important to mention here that when accused\nSavitri Singh entered into witness box, she also made reference about her\nholding/investment/income from such units.               Relevant paragraphs of her\ndeposition are extracted as under:\n20        As   per     D-390,   I   have    taken   certificate   No.\n            48212210633, for 50 units from UTI (Unit trust of India) under my\n            guardianship in the name of my son Gaurav Kumar Singh.

The said amount was deposited in SB a/c\n            No. 1473, Bank of India, BS Marg, New Delhi vide D-114.\n18.16         Evidently, she, too, has made reference about various\nacquisitions prior to the check period. According to the case of prosecution,\nher assets in UTI at the start of check period were Rs. 9,047.50 and such\nassets were worth Rs. 47,022.55 as on the close of check period. However,\nprosecution has not been able to throw sufficient light whether at the time of\nmaking such calculation, it had excluded those units which were either\nacquired before the check period or the units which accused had or might\nhave received by way of bonus.               Undoubtedly, there are number of\ncertificates available on record but for lack of convincing evidence, it will not\nbe possible to come to a firm conclusion either way as no prosecution\nwitness bothered to throw any light over the same.                    Therefore, while\naccepting assets value as on start of check period as Rs. 9,047.50, I am\nforced to hold that there was no further increase in such asset in relation to\nUTI even at the end of check period.\n18.17         As regards income from ULIP, prosecution has taken such\nincome as Rs. 10,575.87 which accrued to her on 06.03.1991. Such fact has\nalso been admitted by accused Savitri Singh in her deposition and, therefore,\nsuch income as mentioned at item no. 12 of Annexure-II also stands proved.\n18.18         As regards Item No. 11 & 12, the prosecution has, again, not\nbeen able to substantiate the expenditure. As per case of prosecution, one\nSh. Malkhan Singh had been given a loan of Rs. 10,000/- and one Sh.\nVishram Singh had been given a loan of Rs. 2,000/- by accused. As far as\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                      Page 98 of 145\nloan allegedly given to Sh. Malkhan Singh is concerned, admittedly, there is\nno document to that effect. No witness has either been examined to prove\nthe aforesaid loan. As regards alleged loan of Rs. 2,000/- to Sh. Vishram\nSingh, prosecution did examine PW-98 Sh. Vishram Singh but to the utter\ndismay of the prosecution, he took a somersault and instead of claiming that\nhe had taken a loan of Rs. 2,000/- from accused Savitri Singh, he rather\nclaimed that he had taken a loan of Rs. 500/- from Smt. Ram Kali.\nProsecution was armed with a document with respect to said loan\ntransaction. Reference be made to D-361 but for the reasons best known to\nthe then prosecutor, Sh. Vishram Singh was never confronted with the\naforesaid executed receipt dated 3.3.1992. Such receipt is lying unproved\nand unexhibited. Thus, both the aforesaid loan entries mentioned at serial\nno. 11 & 12 do not stand proved.\n18.19           As regards item No. 13, according to prosecution, accused\nwere having number of policies issued by LIC and during the check period,\npremium to the tune of Rs. 1,75,073/- was paid. I have seen the relevant\ndocuments contained in D-68, D-117, D-118 and D-378.                      With the great\nassistance rendered by Sh. Rao, Ld. Sr. PP, I went through all such record\nand it becomes evident that the following policies were held by accused\nRam Singh and accused Savitri Singh besides Ashok Kumar Singh:-\nSl.

PW128/2 (part\nof D-68) whereby he had furnished the relevant information to CBI. Letter\nEx. PW 128/1 talks about the total loan of Rs. 33,320/- paid to holder as loan.\nSuch loan was paid during the check period. Ex. PW128/2 makes reference\nabout the policies which were issued by Jabalpur branch of LIC.\n18.21           PW-136 Sh. G.C. Narang happens to be official of Bank of\nIndia, Chhindwara Branch, M.P. He has deposed that LIC paid a cheque (Ex.\nPW758) of Rs. 33,320/- in favour of Ram Singh and Savitri Singh. He also\nmade reference about another payment from LIC of Rs. 10,000/-. Such\npayment was made by LIC vide cheque dated 5.10.1989 in the name of\nSavitri Singh and cheque has been proved as Ex. P-707.\n18.22           PW-195 Ashwani Ghai has also proved letter Ex. PW 195/1\n(part of D-68. There does not seem to be any dispute regarding the fact that\nsuch policies were held by Sh. Ram Singh, his wife and their children and\nthey were paying premium regularly during the said check period. However, it\nis not made clear by prosecution about mode and source of payment of\npremium in relation to the two policies held by Ashok Kumar Singh.\nTherefore, I am excluding these two policies from the scope of consideration.\nIn view of the documents brought on record, it stands proved that accused\nRam Singh and accused Savitri Singh had paid premium to the tune of Rs.\n1,57,350/- (1,75,037 - 17,723).\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                        Page 100 of 145\n18.23          Similarly, expenditure regarding repayment of loan and interest\nas mentioned at serial No. 14 of Annexure-III, expenditure amount of Rs.\n29,529/- stands proved in view of the details given in Ex. PW128/2 (part of D-\n68).\n18.24          Prosecution has made reference to two entries in relation to\nincome from LIC. These are at serial No. 10 & 11 of Annexure-II. These are\nnot disputed by the defence either and these also stand proved.\n18.25          As regards item no. 15 & 16, according to the prosecution, there\nwas expenditure regarding telephone calls with respect to the telephone\nnumbers installed in DMS, Shadipur Depot and Munirka House of accused\nSavitri Singh.    Documents, to that effect, are contained in D-45 & D-42\nrespectively. Some such documents are also contained in D-46. However,\nfact remains that no official from concerned Telephone Exchange of MTNL\nhas graced the witness box and no other witness has deposed about the\nsame either.     Therefore, such expenditure does not stand proved in any\nmanner whatsoever.\n18.26          As far as expenditure towards education fee as mentioned at\nserial no. 17 to 20 are concerned, reference be made to the testimony of\nPW112 Sh. Kewal Kishan Arora, official from Hindu College and PW113\nDevender Kr. Garg, official from DPS, R.K. Puram, New Delhi.          Relevant\ndocuments as contained in D-67 have been duly proved.             I have gone\nthrough all such documents and the testimony of said two witnesses is also\nvirtually uncontroverted and, therefore, said educational expenses stand\nproved.\n18.27          However, as regards expenditure towards education fee for Sh.\nAshok Kumar Singh in Medical College, Jabal Pur mentioned at Sr. No. 21,\naccording to CBI, there was total expenditure of Rs. 29,484/-. Documents\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 101 of 145\nare contained in D-57 but these have not been proved by anyone during the\ntrial.   On the contrary, DW1 Sh. Ashok Kumar Singh has categorically\ndeposed in his cross-examination that his educational expenses were borne\nby his mother. Be that as it may since no one was examined from said\nmedical college of Jabal Pur, said expenditure does not stand proved.\n18.28         As regards the expenditure mentioned at serial no. 22 of\nAnnexure-III, according to CBI, a sum of Rs. 1,000/- was spent by accused\nfor procuring telephone connection in Bhopal. I have seen the testimony of\nPW114 Sh. Subhash Chander Sharma. He retired as Superintendent, BSNL,\nBhopal and has proved the documents contained in D-47. His testimony and\ndocuments contained in D-47 clearly go on to indicate that accused Ram\nSingh had paid a sum of Rs. 1,000/- to Department of Telecommunication for\ntaking a telephone connection. Such amount was paid along with application\ndated 02.02.1990. Thus, expenditure of said amount of Rs. 1,000/- stands\nproved. Even otherwise, such expenditure is not disputed by the defence.\n18.29         Coming to item no. 23, 25 & 26 of Annexure-III, it is quite\nevident that one Premier Padmini Car (Fiat) was earlier having registration\nnumber as MBJ 6888. It was later on changed to DL-2C 8583. Registration\nbook of said vehicle is admitted as Ex. P-472 (part of D-70) and it becomes\nevident that Sh. Ram Singh was third owner of said motor car. The ownership\nover such vehicle is not disputed and as per registration-book (Ex. P-472), a\nsum of Rs. 375/- was paid towards road tax on 10.7.1990. As regards\ninsurance, reference be made to the testimony of PW-45 B.P. Birla, who has\nproved the insurance policy and related documents. However, his testimony\nmerely indicates that sum of Rs. 762/- was paid as insurance premium on\none occasion, i.e. 15.1.1992. Reference be made to receipt Ex. PW45/G\n(part of D-71). There is no other document showing payment of insurance\npremium for the aforesaid vehicle and, therefore, the insurance expenditure\nstands proved to the extent of Rs. 763/- instead of Rs. 5,300/-. However,\namount of Rs. 375/- mentioned at Item No. 23 and amount towards\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 102 of 145\nacquisition of vehicle mentioned as Rs. 34,800/- at Item No. 26 stand proved.\n18.30         Coming to serial no. 24 of Annexure-III, as per case of\nprosecution, accused Ram Singh was member of Delhi Gymkhana Club and\nbesides making payment of membership charges of Rs. 5,100/-, he had\nincurred various other expenses when he used to come to Delhi Gymkhana\nClub as member during the check period.                I have seen various receipts\ncontained in D-39.\n18.31         Prosecution has examined PW26 Sh. Vinod Kumar Papnai. He\nhas deposed that accused had become member of Delhi Gymkhana Club in\n1988 and had deposited a sum of Rs. 5,100/- towards membership fee vide\nEx. PW26/A. He also deposed that his family members, being dependents,\nwere entitled to avail the facility of the club. Thereafter, PW26 Vinod Kumar\nmade reference about various receipts i.e. Ex. PW26/B to Ex. PW26/T. If\ninitial entrance fee amount of Rs. 5,100/- and the amount under all such\nreceipts are taken into consideration, the total amount would come to Rs.\n10,068/-. Even as per the testimony of PW26 Vinod Kumar Papnai, accused\nRam Singh had paid a sum of Rs. 10.068/- to Delhi Gymkhana Club upto\nApril 1992.   Thus, the total expenditure in this regard is proved as Rs.\n10,068/-.\n18.32         As far as payment of Rs. 600/- to Vir Jyoti Enterprises for\nseeking gas connection as mentioned at Sr. No. 27 is concerned, the solitary\ndocument lying in D-60 is neither admitted nor proved. However, with respect\nto payment of Rs. 500/- to M/s Kamakhya Enterprises for gas connection as\nmentioned at Sr. No. 28, reference be made to the testimony of PW158 Sh.\nMukesh Kumar Aggarwal who happens to be the proprietor of said firm. He\ndeposed that said gas connection was issued on 01.01.1988. Voucher has\nbeen proved as Ex. PW158/1 which shows that a sum of Rs. 500/- was paid\nby the consumer.       Testimony of PW158 Sh. Mukesh Kr. Aggarwal is\nunrebutted and uncontroverted and no argument has been advanced to\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                   Page 103 of 145\ndispute the aforesaid expenditure and, therefore, said expenditure of Rs.\n500/- stands proved.\n18.33         According to CBI, accused had made investment of Rs. 8,000/-\nwith M/s Rockland Leasing Limited. I have seen the documents contained in\nD-326. No official from M/s Rockland Leasing Limited has graced the witness\nbox. Though application is found to be there and relevant record is also\ncontained in D-326, fact remains that no witness has entered into witness\nbox. Therefore, investment mentioned at Sr. No. 29 does not stand proved in\nthe desired manner. Right here I would also like add here that though\nprosecution has examined PW14 Laxmi Chandra but even his testimony\ndoes not seem to be sufficient and convincing for proving said investment.\nHe happens to be neighbour of accused Savitri Singh. He claimed that\napplication form Ex. PW14/A was also bearing his signature. He signed\nbecause as per the requirement of the housing finance, applicant was\nrequired to give the names and addresses of two references and one such\nreference was of said Sh. Laxmi Chandra. Moreover, said witness has not\nsupported the case of prosecution as he did not categorically claim whether\nsuch application form was signed by Savitri Singh in his presence. Be that as\nit may, said expenditure does not stand proved.\n18.34         As regards expenditure towards electricity as mentioned at\nitems no. 30 & 31, since CBI had taken non-verifiable expenditure as 1/3rd of\nthe salary, the expenditure towards electricity bills is required to be excluded.\n18.35         As regard serial no. 32, according to prosecution, payment of\nRs. 81,555/- was paid to Farukhabad Khaad Bhandar.               Documents are\ncontained in D-40 but these have not been proved in any manner\nwhatsoever. No witness from National Fertilizer Limited or for that matter\nfrom Farukhabad Khaad Bhandar has entered into witness box and,\ntherefore, said expenditure does not stand proved. Moreover, said\nexpenditure has to be attributed to Ms. Ramkali who had applied for said\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 104 of 145\ndistributorship.\n18.36         As regards serial no. 33, according to prosecution, a sum of Rs.\n13,828/- was spent by way of repayment of bank loan but no sufficient light\nhas been thrown with respect to any such bank loan. No prosecution witness\nhas said anything specifically about any such repayment. There are number\nof bank accounts held by accused and his family members and it was\nexpected that prosecution would have come with complete precision instead\nof leaving the task to the Court.           Therefore, said amount is held as not\nproved.\n18.37         As regards serial no. 34, prosecution has taken 1/3rd of gross\nsalary as non-verifiable          expenditure (towards household       and other\nmiscellaneous       expenditure) and such amount has been accordingly\ncalculated as Rs.163036/-. In such type of disproportionate assets matters,\n1/3rd amount of the income is assumed to be spent on household\nexpenditure. This is done in terms of case of\nSajjan Singh Vs. State of\nPunjab\nAIR 1964SC 464 where it is observed that taking the most liberal\nview, it was not possible for any reasonable man to say that assets to the\nextent of Rs. 1, 20,000/- was anything but disproportionate to a net income of\nRs. 1,03,000/- out of which at least Rs. 36,000/- must have been spent in\nliving expenses.\n18.38         As per CBI, Sh. Ram Singh had drawn net salary of Rs.\n2,79,948/-. Documents in this regard are contained in D-75 & D-76 which are\nadmitted by accused Ram Singh as Ex. P-475 & P-487. Net salary of Savitri\nSingh has been taken as Rs. 2,10,348/-. These documents are contained in\nD-73 & D-74 and these are also admitted as Ex. P-473 & P-474 and\nprosecution has also examined PW34 Sajni Talwar, PW35 Malar Vizhy and\nPW36 Attar Singh to prove the salary of accused Savitri Singh. Such income\nis not disputed.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 105 of 145\n18.39        Sh. Rao has stated that as per circular no. 21/40/99-PD (PT)\ndated 27.11.2001 issued by CBI, instructions have been given for\nstandardizing the procedure for investigation into the assessment of wealth\npossessed by public servants and according to such circular, if husband and\nwife both have independent sources of income, the income of the spouse\nwith higher salary shall be the base of computing the unverifiable\nexpenditure. It would be important to mention that as per said instructions, it\nhas been    prescribed that non-variable expenditure such as on kitchen,\nhousehold, clothing etc should be taken as 1/3 rd of gross salary as a last\nresort after attempting to quantify the expenses broadly under each of\nthese heads by verification. It is also mentioned that electricity and water\ncharges are also not to be computed separately when unverifiable\nexpenditure is computed in the above mentioned manner.\n18.40        Thus, for said purpose, it is the gross salary which is to be\ntaken into consideration and not the net salary. The details of gross salary of\naccused Ram Singh were accordingly calculated by the Court with the help of\nSh. Rao which was found to be Rs. 5,47,434/-. His salary is higher than his\nwife's salary. One third of such gross salary would come to Rs. 1,64,230/-.\nHowever, since the expenditure in this regard has been taken as Rs.\n1,63,036/- in the charge-sheet, same is taken as proved.\nINCOME OF ACCUSED\n\n\n19.0         Income from known sources of accused during the check period\nhas been detailed in Annexure-II and there does not seem to be any real\ndispute with respect to the most of such entries even by the defence.\n19.1         Net salary of Sh. Ram Singh has been admitted by him and net\nsalary of Savitri Singh has been duly proved. As far as rent received from\nNoida house is concerned, though same has been assessed as Rs. 27,000/-\nyet since such house happens to be in the name of Smt. Ram Kali and said\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 106 of 145\nhouse has been excluded from the scope of consideration, rental income\nfrom said Noida house also cannot be reckoned.\n19.2         As regards interest income from various shares, bank accounts\nand FDRs, investigating agency has not bothered to give individual and\nspecific details and seems to have taken for granted that court may itself\nindulge into such herculean exercise. Whatever might be the reason, behind\nthe same, I, for the moment, give benefit to accused about such interest\nincome in toto due to total apathy of investigating agency on said score.\n19.3         Housing Building Advance of Rs. 1,25,000/- was sanctioned to\naccused Ram Singh and such aspect has been duly proved by prosecution in\nview of the testimony of PW129 Sh. C.W. Lobo. Similarly, there does not\nseem to be any dispute regarding GPF of accused Ram Singh and about his\ngetting bank loan.\n19.4         According to accused Savitri Singh, as regards Bhopal house,\nshe had received rental income to the tune of Rs. 3,44,350/- whereas\nprosecution has reckoned the said income as Rs. 1,96,000/- only. Similarly,\nas regards Delhi house, she has claimed that she had rental income to the\ntune of Rs. 1,90,750/-.      In her deposition dated 31.10.2917, she simply\nclaimed that she rented out one flat to Sh. S.C. Mathur and the rent was Rs.\n1,000/- per month from 01.08.1979 for 11 months. According to her, she\ndeclared the same in her ITR also. Except for the aforesaid assertion, she\nhas not produced any record or adduced any evidence to show that she was\nhaving rental income much more than what has been projected by CBI.\nMerely because, she had mentioned her rental income for the assessment\nyear 1992-93 as Rs. 36,000/- per year would not mean that she was deriving\nthat much rental income throughout the check period. Moreover, such return\nwas filed by her after the registration of FIR and, therefore, there is a\npossibility that she might have deliberately introduced exaggerated facts\nwhile filing such return to take some undue advantage later on. Munirka flat\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 107 of 145\nhad been given on rent for Rs. 3,000/- per month and the copy of rent deed\non record is for a period of three years i.e. 1991-1992, 1992-1993 & 1993-\n1994. These are contained in D-43. Be that as it may, fact remains that\naccused has not been able to show that her rental income was much more\nthan what has been estimated by CBI.\n19.5          As regards foreign remittance of Rs. 57,313.09, defence has\nnot been able to place on record any document which may show that foreign\nremittance was more than the aforesaid amount.\n19.6          Right here, I would also like to take up the aspect asserted by\ndefence regarding additional income from sale of jewellery.\n19.7          According to Sh. M.P. Singh, learned defence counsel, accused\nSavitri Singh belonged to an affluent family and she was having sufficient\njewellery articles with her even at the start of check period. He has argued\nthat investigating agency was unjustified in not taking into consideration her\njewellery articles at the beginning of check period i.e. on 01.01.1985. Savitri\nSingh joined Income Tax Department in the year 1969 and she got married\n13.04.1971 and the FIR was registered in the year 1992 and it would not be\nappropriate to hold that all these years i.e. right from 1971 till 1985, she did\nnot possess even a single ornament. Since accused Savitri Singh was from\na well off family and her father had retired as a very senior officer from\nIncome Tax Department, I give benefit to her to the extent of jewellery articles\nworth Rs. 2 lacs and it is assumed that she must be holding jewellery articles\nworth Rs. 2 lacs, at least, at the start of check period.\n19.8          According to Savitri Singh, she had sold jewellery articles from\ntime to time during the check period and had total income of Rs. 1,67,345/-.\nAs per her assertion, she derived income in the following manner:-\nCBI Vs.

As regards intimation\nregarding sale of jewellery articles worth Rs. 54,300/-, D-8 contains one letter\nallegedly written by Savitri Singh to her employer purportedly received by her\nemployer on 18.05.1990. I have no option but to admit the aforesaid letter as\nwell for two reasons. Firstly, no one has been examined from M/s Khanna\nJewellers in order to show that such receipt was a bogus one. Secondly,\nwhen the concerned officials from the office of accused Savitri Singh entered\ninto witness box, it was never suggested to them that no such intimation was\never received in the office. According to Sh. Rao, there is a possibility that\naccused had prepared a bogus intimation and might have kept such\nintimation with her without actually informing the employer. However, if that\nwas so, such fact should have been got clarified and it should have been\nclearly asked from the concerned official whether any such intimation\nregarding sale of jewellery articles worth Rs. 54,300/- was ever received in\nthe department or not. Therefore, it will not be possible for me to straightway\ndiscard such intimation, copy of which is contained in D-8 and which is, even\notherwise, admitted by the defence.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                         Page 109 of 145\n19.10        Thus, as regards income from sale of jewellery articles, since\naccused Savitri Singh had reported her employer about sale of jewellery\nworth Rs. 75,592/- (11,500/- + 9,792/- + 54,300), said amount is required to\nbe reckoned as her additional income during the check period.\n19.11        Accused has also claimed that she had agriculture income of\nRs. 2,52,000/- during the check period but she has not been able to elaborate\nthe same in the desired manner. Moreover, if one has to derive any such\nincome, one is also required to invest a lot in farming towards purchase of\nseeds, fertilizer, crop management besides manpower for supervision. No\nsuch aspect has been highlighted by the defence in any manner whatsoever.\n19.12        It has also been baldly claimed that she and her husband had\nbeen receiving gifts from time to time without coming up anything in specific\non said aspect.    As held in\nState of Karnataka Vs. Selvi J. Jayalalitha &\nOrs\n(2017)6 SCC 263, gifts to a public servant in the context of\nSections\n161\nto\n165A\nIPC now integrated into\nPC Act\nare visibly illegal and forbidden\nby law. The endeavour to strike a distinction between \"legal\" and \"unlawful\"\nas sought to be made to portray gifts to constitute a lawful source of income\nis thus wholly misconstrued.\n19.13        As regards the amount which accused Savitri Singh received\nfrom her father after his death, prosecution has taken the amount as Rs.\n35,994/- as per Sr. No. 17 of Annexure-II (Income Chart) and reference in this\nregard be made to D-114 as said amount landed in the bank account of\naccused Savitri Singh which she was maintaining with Bank of India, Bahadur\nShah Zafar Marg. As per defence, such amount of inheritance from the estate\nof her father was around Rs. 85,000/-. This has been asserted on the basis of\nprobate granted by a competent court of Delhi. Copy of such probate order\nwas shown during final arguments. Though, it was not attempted to be\nproved in any manner, keeping in mind the fact that it is a judicial order, the\nauthenticity of which has been undertaken by Sh. M.P.Singh by asserting to\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 110 of 145\nthat effect at the Bar, I assume such income as Rs. 85,000/-.\n19.14        Remaining entries of income as given in Annexure II are also\nheld as proved as these are, even otherwise, not disputed.\nASSETS AT THE START OF CHECK PERIOD\n\n\n20.0         As regards assets held at the beginning of check period,\naccused Savitri Singh had admitted all such assets (except for Noida house\nmentioned at serial no. 4) and investment mentioned at Serial No. 7. Noida\nhas already been excluded and the investment mentioned at serial no.7 does\nnot stand proved and, therefore, same stand excluded.\nVARIOUS OTHER INVESTIGATIONAL ASPECTS\n\n\n21.0         I have also seen the deposition of PW188 Sh. Rajender Singh\nJaggi who remained involved with the investigation.          He has proved the\ncomplaint as well as FIR.         He has also made reference about various\nsearches conducted during the investigation and also deposed about\ncollection of various documents from various banks. His cross-examination is\nhardly of any significance or substance. I have also seen the testimony of\nPW190 J.S. Emmanuel, PW191 D.C. Sorari, PW192 M.C. Thapliyal, PW196\nDhiraj Khetrapal, PW197 M.C. Joshi and PW199 Roby Jawahar and various\naspects related to investigation stand proved.         Sanctions have also been\nproved appropriately and there is no challenge to the grant of sanction or that\nit was accorded by an authority not competent to grant such sanction.\n21.1         It has been argued by Sh. M.P. Singh, learned defence counsel\nthat though the FIR had been lodged in the year 1992 yet fact remains that\nthe check period taken by prosecution is from 01.01.1985 to 13.04.1992 and\nthe\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n1988 came into force w.e.f. 09.09.1988\nwhereby the previous Act i.e.\nPrevention of Corruption of Act\n1947 was\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 111 of 145\nrepealed and thus the check period falls partly in the period prior to the\nenforcement of\nPC Act\n1988 and, therefore, the explanation introduced in the\nnew Act of 1988 as appearing along with\nSection 13 (1) (e)\nof PC Act, 1988\ncannot be made applicable as it would amount to violation of constitutional\nrights of accused as such penal provision cannot be applied retrospectively.\n21.2         I have also considered such defence contention whereby he\nhas asserted that the explanation of\nSection 13 (1)(e)\nof PC Act 1988 which\nwas introduced in the statue book only on 09.09.1988 cannot be read\nretrospectively.\nIn this regard, reference be made to the judgment given by\nour own High Court in the case of\nVirender Singh Vs. CBI (DOD\n:\n22.11.2010). Para-13 of said judgment reads as under:\n\"\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the PC Act, 1988 and 5(1)(e) of\n             the\nPC Act, 1947\nare identical and pari materia (except\n             for two changes or additions noticed below). It is,\n             therefore,   not     possible    to     accept    the    contention\n             that\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the PC Act, 1988 enacts a new\n             offence. It does not make any difference if the check\n             period overlaps the\nPC Act, 1947\nand the\nPC Act, 1988\n. It\n             is not possible to accept the contention that the check\n             period in the case in question is prior to 9th September,\n             1988 and, therefore, the\nPC Act, 1988\nis being given\n             retrospective      effect   in   view     of     the    authoritative\n             pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Sajjan Singh's\n             case (supra).\"\n21.3         In said case of\nVirender Singh\n(Supra), it was observed that\nthe two changes/additions in\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the PC Act,1988 were the\nExplanation and removal of the clause giving discretion to the Courts to\naward punishment of less than one year for reasons to be recorded in writing\nand it was also asserted before the Hon'ble Bench that the explanation had\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                             Page 112 of 145\ncreated a new offence and such assertion was negated and it was observed\nthat such explanation has limited effect of defining expression \"known source\nof income\" used in\nSection 13 (1) (e)\nof PC Act 1988 holding further that\nburden in such type of matters was on the accused as the facts were within\nhis special knowledge and, therefore,\nSection 106\nof Indian Evidence Act was\napplicable and in such background, explanation attached to\nSection 13 (1) (e)\nof PC Act 1988 was merely a procedural Section which sought to define the\nexpression \"known source of income\" as sources known to the prosecution\nand not to the accused. It was thus held that such explanation was merely\nprocedural and not substantive and, therefore, it did not create a new offence.\nIt was also held that obligation of accused-public servant to offer satisfactory\nexplanation remained the same under both the enactments and, therefore,\nthere was no distinction between the two penal provisions and that the\nrequirement of the law thus remained the same under both the enactments.\nIn view of aforesaid judgment, defence contention stands fully deflated.\n21.4         Sh. Rao has, on the strength of\nP. Nallamal Vs. State\nAIR 1999\nSC 2556, has contended that any such public servant is required to satisfy\nthe Court by showing that known sources of income are also lawful sources.\nHe has argued that besides being lawful source, the explanation given in\npenal section further enjoins that receipt of such income should have been\nalso duly intimated by the public servant in accordance with the provisions of\nany law applicable to such public servant. It has been re-asserted that at no\npoint of time, accused Savitri Singh had given any substantial information\nregarding her alleged acquisition of various properties and jewellery articles.\nThis Court is also cognizant of the observations given by Hon'ble Apex Court\nin\nState of MP Vs. Awadh Kishore Gupta\nAIR 2004 SC 517 wherein it has\nbeen observed that the legislature has advisedly used the expression\n\"satisfactorily account\".\nThe emphasis must be on the word \"satisfactorily\"\nand the legislature has, thus, deliberately cast a burden on the accused not\nonly to offer a plausible explanation as to how he came by his large wealth,\nbut also to satisfy the Court that his explanation was worthy of acceptance\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh               Page 113 of 145\n21.5         Relying on celebrated case of\nJ. Jayalalitha & Ors\n(supra),\nSh. Rao has contended that affairs of accused would be a matter within his\nspecial knowledge in terms of\nSection 106\nEvidence Act and all the legitimate\nand possible source of income beyond those known to the prosecution were\nmatters within the special knowledge of such public servant and were\nrequired to be substantiated by such public servant only. Admittedly, burden\nof proof of accused may not be that onerous but it certainly has to be\ndischarged on the yardstick of preponderance of probabilities.\nIn Ashok\nDebbarma alias\nAchak Debbarma Vs. State of Tripura\n(2014) 4 SCC 747,\nit has been observed that for recording guilt of the accused, it is not\nnecessary that the prosecution should prove the case with absolute or\nmathematical certainty, but only beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal Courts,\nwhile examining whether any doubt is beyond reasonable doubt, may carry in\ntheir mind, some \"residual doubt\", even though the Courts are convinced of\nthe accused persons' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n21.6         In\nK. Veeraswami v. Union of India\n, (1991) 3 SCC 655, it was\nobserved that the legal burden of proof placed on the accused was not so\nonerous as that of the prosecution, it was enunciated that it would not be\nenough to just throw some doubt on the prosecution version. Referring to the\nexpression \"satisfactorily account\", it was ruled that due emphasis must be\naccorded to the word \"satisfactorily\" which signified that the accused has to\nsatisfy the Court that his explanation was worthy of acceptance. It was also\nheld that though such procedure was contrary to the well known principle of\ncriminal jurisprudence that the burden of proof lay always on the prosecution\nand did never shift to the accused, the competence of the Parliament to shift\nsuch burden on certain aspects and particular in matters especially in the\nknowledge of the accused was acknowledged. It was held that if one\npossesses assets beyond his legitimate means, it goes without saying that\nthe excess is out of ill-gotten gain observing that assets are not drawn like\nNitrogen from the air and that have to be essentially acquired, for which\nmeans are necessary.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh              Page 114 of 145\n21.7         I have also seen various intimations contained in file Ex.\nPW129/2 (D-399) whereby accused Ram Singh had informed his employer\nabout the acquisition of movable and immovable properties. Except for his\nacquiring fridge and Maruti Car and one immovable property i.e. H. No. E-\n7/717, Bhopal and about his wife acquiring flat in Munirka, he did not inform\nabout any other acquisition. Savitri Singh has also not informed about any\nacquisition to her employer.\n21.8         Testimony of PW189 Dr. M.A. Ali, Handwriting Expert is also\nvirtually unimpeached which proves to be a certain nemesis for defence.\n21.9         As regard evidentiary value of opinion and testimony of\nhandwriting expert, before a Court can act on the opinion evidence of a\nhandwriting expert two things must be proved beyond any manner of doubt,\nnamely, (i) the genuineness of the specimen/admitted handwriting of the\nconcerned accused and (ii) the handwriting expert is a competent, reliable\nand dependable witness whose evidence inspires confidence. Once these\nare established, the conviction can be based even on the sole circumstance\nof such opinion of expert.       It would be worthwhile to make reference to\njudgment of\nMurari Lal Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\nAIR 1980 SC 531\nwherein it has been held as under:\n\"There is no rule of law nor any rule of prudence\n             which has crystalized into a rule of law that opinion\n             evidence of a hand-writing expert must never be\n             acted upon unless substantially corroborated. But\n             having due regard to the imperfect nature of the\n             science of identification of handwriting, the approach\n             should be one of caution. Reasons for the opinion\n             must be carefully probed and examined. All other\n             relevant evidence must be considered. In\n             appropriate cases, corroboration may be sought. In\n             cases where the reasons for the opinion are\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh             Page 115 of 145\nconvincing and there is no reliable evidence throwing\n             a doubt, the uncorroborated testimony of a\n             handwriting expert may be accepted. There cannot\n             be an inflexible rule on a matter which, in the\n             ultimate analysis, is no more than a question of\n             testimonial weight.\"\n21.10        Reference be also made to judgment of State of Maharashtra\nVs. Sukhdeo Singh & Ar. AIR 1992 2100 SC.\n21.11\nSection 120A\nof the IPC defines criminal conspiracy as under:-\n\"120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy. - When two or\n             more persons agree to do, or cause to be done, -\n(1) an illegal act, or\n             (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an\n             agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy.\nProvided that no agreement except an agreement to\n             commit an offense shall amount to a criminal conspiracy\n             unless some act besides the agreement is done by one\n             or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.\"\n21.12        The    conspiracy requires an             act   (actus   reus)   and   an\naccompanying mental state (mens rea). The agreement constitutes that act\nand the function to achieve the unlawful objective of that agreement\nconstitutes the required mental state. All conspirators are liable for crimes\ncommitted in furtherance of the conspiracy by any member of the group. One\nwho enters into a conspiracy is liable for every reasonable foreseeable act\ncommitted by every other member of this conspiracy in furtherance of its\nobjective, whether or not he knew all about the crime or aided in their\ncommission. It is not essential that all the conspirators must know each and\nevery detail of the conspiracy. Thus, conspirators are liable on an \"agency\ntheory\" for statements of co-conspirators, just as they are for the overt acts\nand crimes committed by their conferrers.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                     Page 116 of 145\n21.13       Interpreting the provisions of\nSection 120A\nand\n120B\nof IPC, the\nApex Court in case of\n'Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab\n', (1977) 4 SCC\n540, observed as under:-\n\" The offence of criminal conspiracy under Section 120-A\n            is a distinct offence introduced for the first time in 1913 in\n            Chapter V-A of the Penal Code. The very agreement,\n            concert or league is the ingredient of the offence. It is not\n            necessary that all the conspirators must know each and\n            every detail of the conspiracy as long as they are co-\n            participators in the main object of the conspiracy. There\n            may be so many devices and techniques adopted to\n            achieve the common goal of the conspiracy and there\n            may be division of performances in the chain of actions\n            with one object to achieve the real end of which every\n            collaborator must be aware and in which each one of\n            them must be interested. There must be unity of object or\n            purpose but there may be plurality of means sometimes\n            even unknown to one another, amongst the conspirators.\n            In achieving the goal several offences may be committed\n            by some of the conspirators even unknown to the others.\n            The only relevant factor is that all means adopted and\n            illegal acts done must be and purported to be in\n            furtherance of the object of the conspiracy even though\n            there may be sometimes mis-fire or over-shooting by\n            some of the conspirators. Even if some steps are\n            resorted to by one or two of the conspirators without the\n            knowledge of the others it will not affect the culpability of\n            those others when they are associated with the object of\n            the conspiracy. The significance of criminal conspiracy,\n            under Section 120-A is brought out pithily by this Court\n            in\nMajor E.G Barsay v. State of Bombay\n[AIR 1961 SC\n            1762: (1962) 2 SCR 195, 228: (1962) 2 Cri LJ 828] thus:\n\"The gist of the offence is an agreement to break the law.\n            The parties to such an agreement will be guilty of criminal\nCBI Vs.

So too, it is not an ingredient of the\n             offence that all the parties should agree to do a single\n             illegal act. It may comprise the commission of a number\n             of acts. Under\nSection 43\nof the Indian Penal Code, an\n             act would be illegal if it is an offence or if it is prohibited\n             by law. Under the first charge the accused are charged\n             with having conspired to do three categories of illegal\n             acts and the mere fact that all of them could not be\n             convicted separately in respect of each of the offences\n             has no relevancy in considering the question whether the\n             offence of conspiracy has been committed. They are all\n             guilty of the offence of conspiracy to do illegal acts,\n             though for individual offences all of them may not be\n             liable.\"\n21.14        In\nState of Maharashtra v. Pollonji Darabshaw Daruwalla\n[AIR 1988 SC 88], it has been held that once the prosecution establishes the\ningredients of the offence of criminal misconduct by proving, by the standard\nof criminal evidence, that the public servant is, or was at any time during the\nperiod of his offence, in possession of pecuniary resources or property\ndisproportionate to his sources of income known to the prosecution, the\nprosecution discharges its burden of proof and the burden of proof is lifted\nfrom the shoulders of the prosecution and descends upon the shoulders of\nthe defence. It then becomes necessary for the public servant to satisfactorily\naccount for the possession of such properties and pecuniary resources. It is\nerroneous to predicate that the prosecution should also disprove the\nexistence of the possible sources of income of the public servant.\n21.15        Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case titled \"\nRekha Rani Vs.

Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                      Page 118 of 145\n21.16        According to defence, the assets were never benami and\nmoreover the additional income was duly reported to the tax authorities and\nwere adjudicated in the favour of assessee and, therefore, such adjudication\nhas to be given full importance and evidentiary value. In the case in hand,\nonly oral argument has been advanced to that effect and no such ITR has\nbeen placed on record and no argument has been raised on the basis of any\nsuch ITR. Moreover, Hon'ble Apex court in case titled \"State of Tamilnadu\nVs. N. Suresh Ranjan & Ors. (Crl. Apeal no. 2223/2014 dated\n06.01.2014 )\" held that the mere fact that the property in the name of the\nincome tax assessee itself cannot be a ground to hold that it actually belongs\nto such an assessee. In case, such a proposition is accepted then in their\nopinion it will lead to disastrous consequences and it will give opportunity to\npublic servant to amass property in the name of known persons, pay income\ntax on their behalf and put themselves out of the mischief of the law.\n21.17        Manner in which investment was made to acquire various other\nimmovable properties coupled with the recovery of various passbooks and\ntitle deeds of alleged benami accounts from the conscious possession of\naccused persons clearly go on to indicate that acquisition was made by them\nonly albeit in benami names. Prosecution has been able to discharge initial\nburden and it was for the accused to show to the contrary. As already noticed\nabove, essence of benami is the intention of the party which is generally\nconcealed behind a thick veil and, therefore, there is no absolute formula or\nacid test uniformly applicable in all situation and such ticklish aspect related\nto benami holdings is to be decided while keeping in mind various factors and\ncircumstances already enumerated above.                These may not be the only\nfactors but these would certainly create impact either way and would be\nsufficient to raise a strong inference with respect to the aspect whether\nproperty had been purchased in benami name or not.\n21.18        Thus, in the final analysis and as upshot of my foregoing\ndiscussion, the details of Income, assets (at the start of check period and at\nCBI Vs.

Assets at the beginning of the check period i.e. 1.1.85                5,63,069.00\n\n2       Income during check period                                            16,23,434.00\n\n3.      Expenditure during check period                                        5,20,835.00\n\n4.      Likely savings (2-3)                                                  11,02,399.00\n\n5.      Assets at the close of check period i.e. on 13.4.92                   49,42,624.00\n\n6.      Assets acquired during check period (5-1)                             43,79,555.00\n\n7.      Total disproportion in assets (6-4)                                   32,77,156.00\n\n\n\n\n21.20            Thus, accused Savitri Singh is found in possession of\ndisproportionate assets to the tune of Rs. 32,77,156/-. She had\naccumulated such disproportionate assets with the aid of her deceased\nhusband Ram Singh and, therefore, she is held guilty for commission of\noffence under\nSections 13(1)(e)\n&\n13(2)\nof PC Act r/w\nSection 120B\nIPC.\n21.21            It also stands proved that she had opened forged bank\naccounts. As per charges, she had forged the documents for opening\naccounts in the name of Rajkumari Singh [(i) Syndicate Bank, Sector-5, R.K.\nPuram Branch, New Delhi, ii Union Bank of India, Moti Bagh, New Delhi) as\nSavitri Devi (Indian Bank Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, (ii) Central Bank of\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                   Page 133 of 145\nIndia, Khan Market, New Delhi)]. As per charges, she had also forged\ncheques in relation to SB Account No. 535, Canara Bank, Munirka Branch,\nNew Delhi in the name of Ashok Kumar Singh. As per charge, she had also\nforged various receipts showing sale of old gold ornaments. During trial, it\ncould not be proved that there was any forgery in relation to preparation of\nreceipts regarding sale of jewellery. Keeping in mind the charges framed and\nin view of the foregoing discussion and the evidence adduced during the trial,\nit stands established that accused Savitri Singh had committed forgery in\nrelation to accounts as under:\n(i) SB Account No. 320030 Syndicate Bank, Sector-8, R.K. Puram\n             Branch opened in the name of Raj Kumari Singh.\n(ii) SB Account No. 2449, UBI Moti Bagh, New Delhi opened in the\n             name of Raj Kumari Singh.\n(iii) Forging cheques by signing in the name of account holder Ashok\n             Kumar Singh having SB Account No. 535, Canara Bank, Munirka\n             Branch,New Delhi.\n21.22        By indulging in act of forgery as aforesaid, she has made\nherself liable under\nSections 467\n/\n471\nIPC. However, no role of accused Ram\nSingh (since deceased) stands surfaced for said acts of forgery and,\ntherefore, Savitri Singh alone is held guilty for said offences of\nIndian Penal\nCode\nin her personal capacity.\nOBJECTIONS UNDER CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ORDINANCE, 1944\n\n\n22.0         There is one more important and significant limb of prosecution\ncase.\n22.1         Since the investigation had revealed that various benami\nproperties had been acquired and several bank accounts had been opened in\nthe names of others, investigating agency apprehended that such properties\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 134 of 145\nmay not be disposed of during the trial of the case and, therefore, vide order\ndated 04.10.1999 passed by the Central Government in exercise of powers\nconferred under\nSection 3 (1) (2)\nof Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance\n1944 r/w\nSection 29\nof Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, Sh. M.C. Joshi,\nDSP/CBI was authorized to make an application before the Court of Special\nJudge, Delhi for attachment of such assets.               Pursuant to such order, an\napplication was filed before the Court. Such application was directed against\neighteen persons, namely, Ram Singh (since expired), Smt. Savitri Singh\n(accused), Jitender Kumar Singh, Gaurav Kumar Singh, Sangita Bala, Ashok\nKumar Singh, Ram Avtar Singh, Ram Prakash Singh, Puttu Lal, Mrs. Raj\nKumari Singh, Mrs. Savita Devi, Mrs. Ram Kali (since deceased), Mrs.\nKusum Lata Das, Sudhansu, Rohit Singh, Ms. Sweeta Singh, Ankita Singh\nand Aarushi and it was prayed that all movable and immovable properties\nacquired in the benani names by the accused may be attached.\n22.2          Notice was issued to all the respondents.               It will be also\nimportant to mention that vide order dated 21.01.2000, when the notice of the\napplication was issued, it was also directed that properties detailed in Para 4\nto 4.5 of the petition may be attached.\n22.3          All such respondents put in appearance and objections were\nalso filed by them.\n22.4          I have gone through the written statements/objections filed by\nvarious such objectors.\n22.5          Accused Ram Singh (since expired) gave reference about two\nterms deposits in his objection petition.              He also claimed that jewellery\narticles, as recovered from the lockers of PNB (Green Park), State Bank of\nPatiala House (Shastri Bhawan), Oriental Bank of Commerce (Munirka) did\nnot belong to him and no such jewellery articles had been purchased by him\nduring his service period. He claimed that possession of such jewellery had\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                     Page 135 of 145\nalready been explained by accused Savitri Singh and she had also received\njewellery as 'istridhan'. As regards cash, he claimed that cash of Rs. 50,000/-\nbelonged to Sh. Ram Prakash Singh, another sum of Rs. 50,000/- to Sh.\nUday Vir Singh and another Rs. 50,000/- to Ram Snehi Singh who have\nalready filed their respective claims before the Court. He also claimed that\nafter the death of Ram Snehi, his wife Sukh Devi had staked the claim. As\nregards cash amount of Rs. 8,650/- found in the Noida house, it was\nallegedly claimed that the same to his mother Ram Kali. As regards Indira\nVikas Patras, he claimed that his wife Savitri Singh had already explained\nthat IVPs worth Rs. 25,500/- belonged to late Smt. Savitri Devi, IVPs worth\nRs. 15,000/- belonged to late Baba Narsingh Das and IVPs worth Rs.\n20,000/- belonged to Sh. Ram Prakash Singh which had been kept by them\nwith accused Savitri Singh for safe custody. He claimed that IVPs worth Rs.\n11,500/- belonged to accused Savitri Singh which she had purchased from\nfamily savings from time to time.            As regards immovable property, he\nadmitted ownership over H. No. E-7/717, Shahpura, Bhopal, MP while\nsupplementing that Plot No. U-45/2, Qutab Enclave, Gurgaon, Haryana had\nthough been purchased in the joint names of Jitender Kumar Sigh and\nhimself (Ram Singh) but in fact, such flat belonged to Sh. Jitender Kumar\nSingh only who had made investment from his own resources and income.\n22.6          Accused Savitri Singh also filed separate claim/objections. She\ndid admit various bank accounts and FDRs in her such objection petition and\nattempted to justify the source thereof as well. As regards jewellery articles\nfound in lockers, she claimed that during investigation, she had explained in\ndetail qua the jewellery belonging to her as her 'istridhan' and the fact that the\njewellery belonged to some other persons had been kept by her for safe\ncustody.   As regards cash and Indira Vikas Patras, she took the stand\nconsistent with the version of her husband.             As regards immovable\nproperties, she admitted that she had purchased Plot No. 50, Khasra No.\n128/18, Sainik Niketan, Dichau Kalan. She admitted investment regarding\nFlat No. 558-710-0329, Indira Puram Ghaziabad, UP as well as land at\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                 Page 136 of 145\nVillage Bawaria Kalan, Bhopal, MP. She also owned up investment regarding\nRegistration No. 5175 at Greater Noida to the tune of Rs. 17,000/-. As\nregards, flat of Ocean Plaza, Noida, she claimed that it belonged to her\nmother-in-law Smt. Ram Kali and that the entire investment was made by her\n(Ram Kali) from her agriculture income and other resources. As regards Flat\nNo. IV/002, Vaishali Housing Scheme, Ghaziabad, UP, according to Savitri\nSingh, it belonged to Smt. Raj Kumari Singh in her own right. As regards\nagricultural land at Village Kakuli, Khasra No. 283, Farukhabad, UP,\naccording to her, such land had been purchased by Smt. Ram Kali, though, in\nher name (name of Savitri Singh). According to her, the entire payment for\nsaid land was made by Smt. Ram Kali from her own resources and her own\nagricultural income. No investment was made by her and her husband Ram\nSingh. Similar stand was taken by her in relation to one Kothari at Village\nKakuli, Farukhabad. Nothing further was mentioned by her with respect to\nany other immovable property in her claim/objection.\n22.7          Sh.   Jitender     Kumar      Singh      has   also   filed   a    detailed\nclaim/objection petition.    He also entered into witness box DW7 and his\ndeposition has already been discussed in the earlier part of the judgment.\n22.8          Sh. Gaurav Kumar Singh has claimed in his objection/claim that\nhe had received jewellery in family partition and also on various family\nfunctions and these were kept by his mother Smt. Savitri Singh for safe\ncustody. He claimed that he had received small amount of cash-gifts and\nother small savings which were deposited by him in his bank account and\nFDRs were prepared from bank balance and were renewed from time to time.\nHe claimed that his grandmother Smt. Ram Kali had purchased a piece of\nagricultural land in his name out of love and affection in his Village Kakuli,\nFarukhabad and that the entire investment was made by his grandmother\nSmt. Ram Kali and he himself did not contribute anything in this regard. He\nalso claimed that a bracelet, two set of gold and ten gold bangles belonged to\nhim. He, however, did not enter into witness box in support of his claim.\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                        Page 137 of 145\n22.9          Smt. Sangeeta Bala Singh (daughter of accused) also filed a\nseparate claim but she also did not enter into witness box.\n22.10         Dr. Ashok Kumar Singh has entered into witness box as DW1\nand I have already gone through his deposition. He staked his claim over\nFlat No. 240, Anand Kunj, Wazid Pur, Ghaziabad, Plot No. 46/21, Raj Nagar\nExtension-II, Palam, New Delhi, membership in Poornima Co-operative\nHousing Society Ltd., application (vide Regn. No. 6474), Greater Noida and\napplication No. 59198 with Ghaziabad Development Authority. He claimed\nthat for the purpose of acquisition of aforesaid properties, he had made\ninvestment from his own resources.\n22.11         Sh. Ram Avtar Singh (DW5) staked his claim over one property\nof Paschim Vihar and investment related to application moved before Greater\nNoida Authority with respect to Registration No. 6471.\n22.12         Sh. Ram Prakash Singh (DW2) claimed that he had applied for\nproperty with Greater Noida Authority vide Registration. No. 007723 and\ninvestment was made by him. He also claimed that various jewellery articles,\nas contained in locker of State Bank of Patiala (Shastri Bhawan), belonged to\nhim and he also claimed that cash of Rs. 50,000/- belonged to him which was\neventually recovered from the locker of State Bank of Patiala, Shastri\nBhawan. As regards IVPs, he claimed that IVP worth Rs. 27,500/- belonged\nto him.   Fact, however, remains that none of such assertions could be\nsubstantiated by him when he entered into witness box. He simply claimed\nthat he had filed claim application supported with an affidavit but did not make\nany specific assertion either regarding Indira Vikas Patras or applying for said\nimmovable properties at Greater Noida. He vaguely claimed that he was\nearning by selling tobacco-crop. He admitted in his cross-examination that he\nnever paid any income tax. No document has been furnished by him with\nCBI Vs.

Puttu Lal (PW61) staked his claim over one investment\nrelated to application made to Ghaziabad Development Authority for allotment\nof plot vide application no. 18652.\n22.14         Smt. Raj Kumari Singh (DW4) staked her claim over various\njewellery articles as described by her in Para- 1(A) of her application Ex.\nDW4/9.    Besides claiming that she was account holder of saving bank\naccount no. 320030 Syndicate Bank, R.K. Puram Branch and saving bank\naccount no. 7336, Oriental Bank of Commerce (owned up by her daughter\nKumari Ankita Singh) and the related CDR, she also claimed that Flat No.\nIV/002 Vaishali Housing Scheme Ghaziabad, UP was applied for by her and\ninvestment was made by her from her own earnings and savings. She also\nalleged that investment with respect to Plot No. 260, Anant Kunj, Wazid Pur,\nGhaziabad was made by her from her own resources.         In her deposition,\nhowever, she did not make any reference about said Plot No. 260, Anant\nKunj, Wazid Pur. Moreover, her examination does not inspire any confidence\nas she has not been able to disclose as to how she was able to arrange for\nthe amount with the help of which she had made the alleged investment in\nVaishali Housing Scheme or for that matter for getting prepared FDR in the\nname of her children.\n22.15         Savitri Devi (wife of Sh. Ram Pal Singh) also filed separate\nobjection while seeking claim over IVP worth Rs. 27,500/- and immovable\nproperties. However, she did not enter into witness box. As per record, she\nhas already died.\n22.16         Smt. Ram Kali Singh had also filed separate written\nstatement/claim and, unfortunately, even she did not enter into witness box\nas she too, reportedly, expired. Smt. Kusum Lata Das (DW6) staked her\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh            Page 139 of 145\nclaim over gold jewellery and two bank accounts i.e. SB Account No. 17824,\nCentral Bank of India, Press Area, New Delhi and SB account No. 2908,\nCanara Bank, Munirka, New Delhi besides two FDRs.               I have already\ndiscussed about her deposition and evidently, her testimony does not inspire\nmuch confidence. Joint objections have been filed by Sudhanshu and Arushi,\nchildren of Sarita Punia (DW3). Another joint objection petition has been filed\nby Rohit Singh and Kumari Sweta Singh.\n22.17         As regards property bearing no. RZF-761/13, Gali No. 4, Raj\nNagar-II, Palam Colony, New Delhi-77, though Ashok Kumar Singh was\nshown owner of the property on record and though as per CBI, it was benami\nproperty of accused persons, Sh. Khem Chand also put in appearance as\nnon-applicant and filed reply claiming that he was the actual owner of said\nproperty which he had purchased from one Ram Mehar Sharma. He also\nclaimed that he had let out the same to one Ms. Usha and even initiated\neviction proceedings against her. His such application was also treated as\nobjections filed under\nSection 4 (4)\nof Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance\n1944 and simultaneously vide order dated 20.08.2011, Khem Chand was\ndirected not to dispose of said property or create any charge in the property\nwithout permission of the Court till his objections and the objections filed by\nAshok Kumar Singh qua said property were disposed of by the Court.\nHowever, Khem Chand was granted permission to pursue his eviction\nproceedings. As regards, said property of Raj Nagar being claimed by Khem\nChand reference be also made to order dated 15.10.2015 whereby CBI was\ndirected to depute a competent officer for filing detailed report with respect to\nthe aforesaid property after taking assistance of Revenue Officer as well as\nMunicipal Officer.\n22.18         Accordingly, a demarcation report was submitted by the\nCBI Vs. Ram Singh and Savitri Singh                Page 140 of 145\nprosecution before the Court on 22.02.2016. Though at one of point time, it\nwas contemplated that the issues were required to be framed but subsequent\nproceedings indicate that the matter was fixed for arguments on all such\nobjection petitions. Order dated 21.01.2017 also indicates that it was\nobserved by the then learned Presiding Officer that all such objections would\nbe decided along with the main case.\n22.19         Sh. M.P. Singh, learned defence counsel has represented the\ninterest of all such objectors, except for Khem Chand. He has argued that\nattachment order should not have been passed and there was no reason to\nmake the same absolute either. Sh. Suri has, on the other hand, contended\nthat Khem Chand was owner in his own right and, therefore, there was no\nreason to have attached his property. I have heard Mr. Suri and also seen the\nwritten submissions placed by him. Needless to emphasize that a criminal\ncourt cannot be asked to decide a title which, essentially, is job left to civil\ncourt. Both the warring sides i.e. Khem Chand and Ashok Singh are tracing\nownership through the same owner but surprisingly, none of them chose to\ncall him as witness in their respective support.\n22.20         I have already made detailed reference about all bank account\nand each property. Suffice it to say, the worth of disproportionate assets has\nbeen found to be of Rs. 32,77,156/- and keeping in mind the preceding\ndiscussion and material brought on record, I make the order of attachment\nabsolute for the following properties:-\n(A) Immovable Properties as per following description of Annexure IV\nCBI Vs.

Rangammal   against   the   order   dated \n\n\n\n11.07.2002 passed by the learned single Judge of the High \n\n\n\nCourt   of   Judicature   at   Madras   in   Second   Appeal   No. \n\n\n\n703/1992   by   which     the   appeal     was   dismissed   by \n\n\n\npractically     a   summary   order   although   the   substantial \n\n\n\nquestion   of   law   which   was   formulated   at   the   time   of \n\n\n\nadmission of the appeal was as follows:\n\"Whether   the   sale   deed   executed  by   the \n\n          de facto  guardian on behalf of   the minor \n\n          without   the   permission     of   the   court \n\n          could be held to be valid ?\n2.            However,     on   hearing   the   appeal   in   the   light   of \n\n\n\nthe   prevailing     facts   and   circumstances     of   the   instant \n\n\n\nmatter,   we   are   of   the   view     that   the   question     also   arises \n\n\n\nwhether  in a partition suit  filed by the plaintiff/respondent \n\n\n\nNo.1   herein,   the   courts   below   could   shift   the   burden   of \n\n\n\nproof  on the defendant - appellant regarding the validity  of \n\n\n\na   sale   deed,   which   was   executed   when   the   appellant     was \n\n\n\nadmittedly   a minor,  contrary  to  the  pleading     in  the  plaint \n\n\n\nfiled   in   a   suit     for   partition,   who   claimed     title   to   the   suit \n\n\n\nland on the basis of the  alleged sale deed.    Still further the \n\n\n\nquestion   arises   whether   the   question   of   limitation   could \n\n\n\narise   against   the     defendant/appellant   shifting   the   burden \n\n\n\non   her   to   challenge   the   sale   deed,   when   the   story   of \n\n\n\nexecution     of   the   alleged     sale   deed   was   set   up     by   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1     in   the   plaint   for   the   first   time \n\n\n\nwhen   he   filed   partition   suit     against   his   brother,   without \n\n\n\nimpleading the appellant,  but claimed benefit of title to the \n\n\n\nsuit land on the basis of the alleged sale deed.\n3.           In order to  decide the aforesaid  controversy, it is \n\n\n\nnecessary  to relate the facts  giving rise  to  this  appeal  in \n\n\n\nso       \n\n\f\nfar as   it is relevant which disclose that the appellant Tmt.\nRangammal   was   impleaded   as   second   defendant   in   a   suit \n\n\n\nfor   partition   bearing   O.S.

The sale deed was claimed   to have been\n4\nexecuted  for  legal  necessity   in  order  to  discharge   the \n\n\n\ndebt           \n\n\n\n\n\nof     the   deceased   mother   of   the   appellant   in   the   year   1951 \n\n\n\nwhich according to the case of the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 \n\n\n\nhad   been   transferred   to   their   branch   by   virtue   of   the \n\n\n\naforesaid sale deed   executed on   24.2.1951 by the   alleged \n\n\n\nguardian of the appellant  Kumara Naicker.\n4.

The   appellant   herein   who   was   impleaded   as   a \n\n\n\nsecond   defendant     in   the   suit     clearly     pleaded   that   the \n\n\n\npartition     suit     filed   by   Kuppuswami-plaintiff   against   his \n\n\n\nbrother   Andivelu   1st  defendant   -respondent   No.2   herein, \n\n\n\nwas collusive   in nature as this was   clearly to deprive the\n5\nappellant from her share by  relying on an alleged sale deed \n\n\n\ndated 24.2.1951 by fraudulently   stating that the deceased \n\n\n\nmother of the appellant  was owing  certain debt  during her \n\n\n\nlifetime     and     in     order     to     discharge     the     same,   the   so-\ncalled                     \n\n\n\n\n\nlegal guardian  of the appellant Kumara Naicker executed a \n\n\n\nsale deed  in favour of   the father  and uncle  of the plaintiff \n\n\n\nand   defendant   No.1   who   are   respondents   herein.     It   was, \n\n\n\ntherefore,  submitted  by the appellant/2nd defendant  in the \n\n\n\nsuit       that   the sale deed   dated 24.2.1951 alleged to have \n\n\n\nbeen     executed     in   order   to     discharge     the   debt   of   her \n\n\n\ndeceased   mother,     when   the   appellant   was   a  minor,   ought \n\n\n\nnot to be held   legally binding on her   and so as to include \n\n\n\nher   property   for   partition     in   the   partition   suit   which   had \n\n\n\nbeen     instituted     by   an   altogether   different   branch     of   the \n\n\n\nfamily   who     had   separated     more   than   three   generations \n\n\n\nago. Hence she specifically pleaded   that the   partition suit \n\n\n\nincluding her property was clearly collusive in nature   and \n\n\n\ntherefore the suit was fit to be dismissed.\n6\n6.            In   order   to   appreciate   whether   the   courts   below \n\n\n\nwere   justified   in   depriving   the   appellant   Tmt.   Rangammal \n\n\n\nfrom   her   share,   it   appears   necessary   to   relate   some   other \n\n\n\nsalient   facts   of   the   case   leading   up   to   the   filing   of     this \n\n\n\nappeal.   The   schedule-property   comprising   an   area   of   4 \n\n\n\nacres  and  10 cents    described in various    survey numbers \n\n\n\noriginally   belonged   to   one     Laksmi   Naicker-the   common \n\n\n\nancestor   of   contesting   parties   who   had   two   sons     and   an \n\n\n\noral partition had taken place between them in regard to the \n\n\n\nproperties   of   the   joint   family   including   the   schedule-\nproperty.     Thereafter,   a   sale   deed   dated   24.2.1951   in \n\n\n\nrespect   of   the   schedule-property   was   executed   by   Kumara \n\n\n\nNaicker   -alleged   legal   guardian     of   appellant-Rangammal \n\n\n\nwho was   one of the sons of late Kumara Naicker   and wife \n\n\n\nof the elder son of Laksmi Naicker-Thottammal a cousin  of \n\n\n\nher son, who was descendent of  Kumara Naicker.  Kumara \n\n\n\nNaicker,     i.e.   the   son   of   the   elder   son   of   Laksmi   Naicker \n\n\n\nexecuted   the   sale   deed   on   behalf   of   the   appellant   herein, \n\n\n\nwho   was   the   daughter   of     younger   son   of   Laksmi   Naicker \n\n\n\nand   Andi   Naicker     was   admittedly   a   minor,   representing \n\n\n\nhimself  as her guardian since she had lost both  her father\n7\nand   her   mother   at   the   time   of   the   execution   of   the   sale \n\n\n\ndeed.     However,   the   appellant   according   to   her   case \n\n\n\ncontinued   in   possession     of     half   of   the   schedule   property \n\n\n\naccording   to   the   oral   partition   which   had   fallen   into   the \n\n\n\nshare of her father since the  only brother of the appellant/ \n\n\n\nRangammal   had   died   unmarried.     Thus,   the     appellant \n\n\n\ncontinued to be in possession of half of the property without \n\n\n\nany  knowledge about the alleged sale deed.\n7.           The appellant's case  is that   as she was a minor \n\n\n\nand   had   lost   both   her   parents,   she   was   living   with   her \n\n\n\nmaternal   uncle   even   at   the   time   of   the   alleged   sale.       The \n\n\n\nappellant's case is that the suit was instituted between  the \n\n\n\nplaintiff-respondent   No.1   herein   and   1st                 defendant-\nrespondent   No.2   herein  under   the  pretext   of   partition   but \n\n\n\nin   fact  the   idea   behind  institution  of  the   suit  was     to   oust \n\n\n\nthe appellant  who continued to be in possession of  half of \n\n\n\nthe share of the property being the sole legal representative \n\n\n\nof   the   younger   son   of     Laksmi   Naicker   who   was   Andi \n\n\n\nNaicker.       As already stated, the appellant in fact was not \n\n\n\neven   made     a   party   in   the   partition   suit   initially   but   was\n8\nlater   impleaded   as   2nd  defendant     after   she   filed     an \n\n\n\napplication for her impleadment.\n8.           However,   the High Court   while dealing with the \n\n\n\nsecond   appeal   arising   out   of   the   partition   suit,   cast   the \n\n\n\nburden     completely     on   the   appellant/2nd  defendant     to \n\n\n\nprove   that the property shown in the sale   deed which fell \n\n\n\ninto the share of the   appellant, was not for the purpose of \n\n\n\ndischarge   of   the     liability   of   her   deceased   mother   who \n\n\n\naccording   to   her   case   was   not   owing   any   debt   to   anyone \n\n\n\nincluding   Kumara   Naicker.     But   the     suit   was   finally \n\n\n\ndecreed   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff/respondent   No.1   holding \n\n\n\ntherein   that   the   appellant's   deceased   mother     was   owing \n\n\n\ncertain   debts   and   for   discharge   of   the   same,   the   so-called \n\n\n\nlegal   guardian   of   the   appellant   who   was   Kumara   Naicker \n\n\n\nexecuted   a   sale   deed   in   favour   of   the   plaintiff's   father   and \n\n\n\ndefendant No.1's  father       in  respect of  the   entire    property \n\n\n\nof     Rangammal     and     this   was   done   ostensibly     as   the \n\n\n\nappellant's   mother     had   to   discharge   certain   debts   which \n\n\n\nshe   was   owing   to   the   plaintiff's   father   during   her   lifetime.\nThus, the District Munsif, Palani, decreed the suit in favour \n\n\n\nof   the   plaintiff/1st  respondent   herein   Kuppuswami.     While\n9\ndoing   so, the trial court   recorded a finding   that the sale \n\n\n\ndeed dated 24.2.1951 by which  half  share  of the appellant \n\n\n\nin   the   suit   property     was   transferred   when   the   appellant \n\n\n\nwas a minor had been executed  by legal guardian   Kumara \n\n\n\nNaicker     for   legal   necessity       according   to   the   case   of   the \n\n\n\nappellant   herein,   Kumara   Naicker   the   so-called   legal \n\n\n\nguardian   was   neither   her   natural   guardian   nor   guardian \n\n\n\nappointed   by   the   court   and   hence     the   sale   deed  executed \n\n\n\nby him to the extent of half share of the schedule property \n\n\n\nof appellant-Rangammal was clearly void, illegal, inoperative \n\n\n\nand   hence not binding on her.   The trial court decreed the \n\n\n\nsuit against which the appeal before the 1st  appellate court \n\n\n\nwas dismissed.  The matter then came up to the High Court \n\n\n\nby way of a second appeal.\n9.           Learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   while \n\n\n\nchallenging   the     judgment   and   orders   of   the   courts   below \n\n\n\nsubmitted   that   the   sale   deed   executed   by   the   so-called  de  \n\n\n\nfacto guardian Kumara Naicker and Thottammal  cannot be \n\n\n\nheld to be binding         on   her     as   she   was   a   minor   in   the \n\n\n\ncustody   of   her   maternal   uncle   and  not  Kumara     Naicker   -\nfather   of   the   respondent   No.2     and   hence   the   sale   deed\n10\nexecuted by him on her behalf was not binding on her   as \n\n\n\nthe same was executed   in order to deprive  her of her  half \n\n\n\nshare   in     the   disputed   property     which   is   situated   on   the \n\n\n\neastern portion of the schedule property.\n10.           The   learned   single   Judge   of   the   High   Court \n\n\n\nhowever was pleased to dismiss the second appeal   holding \n\n\n\ntherein   that   the   present   suit       out   of   which   the     second \n\n\n\nappeal arose was filed in the year 1982 which was after 31 \n\n\n\nyears   of   the   execution   of   the   sale   deed   dated     24.2.1951.\nThe   single   Judge   further   observed     that   if   the   appellant \n\n\n\nTmt. Rangammal   was aggrieved   of the sale deed executed \n\n\n\nby the de facto  guardian,   she   ought   to   have   challenged   it \n\n\n\nwithin three years  from the date of  attaining majority.  The \n\n\n\nHigh Court  went  on to hold  that until the date  of filing of \n\n\n\nthe present  suit by the  1st  respondent and even thereafter, \n\n\n\nthe   appellant   had   not   chosen   to   challenge   the   sale   deed \n\n\n\nexecuted   by   the  de   facto  guardian   and   she   never   asserted \n\n\n\nany   title   in   respect   of   the   suit   property   irrespective   of   the \n\n\n\nsale   deed   in  order   to   establish  that  she     was     aggrieved  of \n\n\n\nthe  sale deed and hence it was too late for the appellant to\n11\nraise   such   a   plea   in   the   High   Court     by   way   of   a   second \n\n\n\nappeal.\n11.          We have heard learned counsel for the parties  at \n\n\n\nlength and on   a consideration of their   submissions in the \n\n\n\nlight   of   the     judgments   and   orders   of   the   courts   below, \n\n\n\nspecially the High Court, we are clearly of the view that the \n\n\n\nHigh   Court   as   also   the   courts   below   have   clearly \n\n\n\nmisconstrued  the entire case of the plaintiff  as well as the \n\n\n\nrespondents   and   tried   it   contrary   to   the   pleadings.     The \n\n\n\nHigh Court has recorded that   \"the present suit which  was  \n\n\n\nfiled in the year 1982, is after 31 years\" i.e. after 31 years of \n\n\n\nthe execution of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951.   But it can \n\n\n\nbe     instantly   noticed   that  the   High  Court   has  fallen   into  a \n\n\n\ncrystal clear error   as it has   patently   and unambiguously \n\n\n\nmissed   that   the   suit     had   not   been   filed   by   the   appellant \n\n\n\nTmt. Rangammal   as she was   the 2nd   defendant   who was \n\n\n\nlater impleaded in the suit  but the partition  suit had been \n\n\n\nfiled   by   the   plaintiff-Kuppuswami-respondent   No.1   herein \n\n\n\nagainst   his   brother   the   2nd             respondent-Andivelu-1st \n\n\n\ndefendant     which   was   a   suit   for   partition     of   the   property \n\n\n\nbut   while   doing   so   he     included   and   asserted     title   to   the\n12\nproperty in the schedule of the plaint which  admittedly had \n\n\n\nfallen   into     the   share     of   the   appellant's   deceased-father \n\n\n\nwhich     devolved     upon   her     after   the   death   of   her   father, \n\n\n\nmother   and   brother     who   died   unmarried.     But   it   is     the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent No.1 who came up with a   case   in the \n\n\n\nplaint   that this property was transferred for legal necessity \n\n\n\nby   the   so-called   legal   guardian     of   the     appellant   by \n\n\n\nexecuting   a   sale   deed   on   24.2.1951   in   favour   of   the \n\n\n\nrespondents predecessors who were father and uncle  of the \n\n\n\nplaintiff  and 1st defendants/respondents herein.\n12.          The  learned  single   Judge     of  the   High   Court     as \n\n\n\nalso the trial court  and the lower appellate court  thus have \n\n\n\nlost sight of the fact that  it is the plaintiff/respondent No.1 \n\n\n\nherein who had come up with a case that the half share of \n\n\n\nthe     disputed   property     which   on   partition   had   fallen   into \n\n\n\nthe   share     of   the   appellant's   father     was   sold     out   by \n\n\n\nKumara   Naicker   as   guardian   of   the   appellant-who   was   a \n\n\n\nminor in order to discharge some debt which the appellant's \n\n\n\ndeceased   mother   was   alleged   to   be   owing.     However   the \n\n\n\ndisputed property which was sold in order to discharge  the \n\n\n\nalleged burden of debt vide sale deed dated 24.2.1951 was\n13\npurchased  by the plaintiff-1st  respondent's father Arumuga \n\n\n\nGounder     and   their   uncle     Kumara   Naicker   which   means \n\n\n\nthat the legal guardian Kumara Naicker claims the property \n\n\n\nof the appellant who was minor and then sold it  to himself \n\n\n\nand     nephew     Arumuga   Gounder.     Furthermore,   it   is   also \n\n\n\nthe plaintiff's case   that the property which had fallen into \n\n\n\nthe   share     of   Tmt.   Rangammal   had   been   sold   out   by \n\n\n\nKumara   Naicker   to   the   father   of     Kuppuswami-Arumuga \n\n\n\nGounder and Andivelu who was his own  son.\n13.           Therefore,   it   is   more   than   apparent     that   when \n\n\n\nthe   plaintiff/respondent   came   up   with   a   case   of   execution \n\n\n\nof   sale   deed   on   24.2.21951   for   half     of     the   schedule \n\n\n\nproperty/disputed   property     alleged   to   have   been   sold   out \n\n\n\nfor   legal   necessity   which   had   fallen   into   the   share   of \n\n\n\nappellant   Rangammal,   the   burden   clearly       lay   on   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   to   discharge   that   the   sale   deed \n\n\n\nexecuted   by     Kumara   Naicker   to   his   own   son   and   nephew \n\n\n\nArumuga   Gounder     in   regard   to   the   share   which   had \n\n\n\nadmittedly     fallen     into   the   appellant     share     Rangammal \n\n\n\nwho was a minor, was sold  for the legal necessity.  But this \n\n\n\nburden   by   the   trial     court   was   wrongly   cast   upon   the\n14\nappellant/Rangammal     to   discharge,   although,     it   is   well-\nsettled   that  the     party     who  pleads    has  also to  prove  his \n\n\n\ncase.\n14.\nSection   101\nof   the       Indian   Evidence   Act,   1872 \n\n\n\ndefines   `burden   of   proof'   which     clearly   lays   down       that \n\n\n\nwhosoever     desires   any   court     to   give   judgment   as   to   any \n\n\n\nlegal right or law  dependent on the existence of facts which \n\n\n\nhe   asserts,   must   prove   that   those   facts   exist.     When     a \n\n\n\nperson is  bound to prove  the        existence     of  any  fact it is \n\n\n\nsaid  that the burden of proof lies on that person.  Thus, the \n\n\n\nEvidence   Act   has   clearly   laid   down   that   the   burden   of \n\n\n\nproving     fact     always   lies   upon   the   person   who   asserts.\nUntil   such   burden   is   discharged,   the   other   party   is   not \n\n\n\nrequired  to be called upon to prove his case.  The court has \n\n\n\nto examine   as to whether   the person upon whom burden \n\n\n\nlies     has   been   able   to   discharge   his   burden.     Until       he \n\n\n\narrives at such conclusion, he cannot proceed on the basis \n\n\n\nof weakness of the other party.  In view of this legal position \n\n\n\nof   the\nEvidence   Act\n,   it   is   clear   that   in   the   instant   matter, \n\n\n\nwhen   the   plaintiff/respondent   No.1   pleaded   that   the \n\n\n\ndisputed   property     fell   into   the   share   of   the   plaintiff   by\n15\nvirtue of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951, then it was clearly \n\n\n\nfor   the   plaintiff/respondent   No.1   to   prove     that   it   was \n\n\n\nexecuted  for  legal necessity of the appellant-while she was \n\n\n\na   minor.       But,   the   High  Court   clearly   took     an   erroneous \n\n\n\nview     while   holding   that   it   is   the   defendant/appellant   who \n\n\n\nshould   have   challenged   the   sale   deed   after   attaining \n\n\n\nmajority   as   she   had   no   reason   to   do   so   since   the   plaintiff \n\n\n\n/respondent No.1   failed to first of all discharge the burden \n\n\n\nthat   the   sale   deed   in   fact   had   been   executed     for   legal \n\n\n\nnecessity   of   the   minor's   predecessor   mother   was   without \n\n\n\npermission           of         the         court.         It         was         not         the \n\n\n\ndefendant/respondent who  first of all claimed benefit of the \n\n\n\nsale deed  or asserted its genuineness, hence the burden of \n\n\n\nchallenging the sale deed specifically when she had not even \n\n\n\nbeen dispossessed from the disputed share, did not arise at \n\n\n\nall.\n15.          Plethora of commentaries   emerging from   series \n\n\n\nof case  laws  on burden of proof  which are too  numerous \n\n\n\nto   cite,   lay   down   that  when   a   person   after   attaining \n\n\n\nmajority, questions any sale of his property by his guardian \n\n\n\nduring   his   minority,   the   burden   lies   on   the   person   who\n16\nupholds/asserts the purchase not   only to   show that   the \n\n\n\nguardian   had the power to sell   but further that the whole \n\n\n\ntransaction   was   bona   fide.    This     was   held   in   the   case   of\nRoop   Narain  vs.    Gangadhar\n,   9WR   297,  as   also     in  Anna  \n\n\n\nMalay      vs.     Na   U   Ma,      17C   990.   Thus   when   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   came   up   with   a   case   that   the \n\n\n\nminor's share/appellant herein was sold for legal necessity \n\n\n\nby   her   uncle   Kumara   Naicker,   then                  it   was   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   who   should   have   discharged   the \n\n\n\nburden to prove that the minor/appellant's share had been \n\n\n\nsold   of   by   the  de   facto  guardian   Kumara   Naicker   without \n\n\n\npermission of the court, could be held to be legal and valid \n\n\n\nso as to include the same in the partition suit between two \n\n\n\nbrothers,   which   has   not   been   discharged   at   all   by   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1.     In   fact,   the   real   brother   of \n\n\n\nplaintiff   Kuppuswami   who   is   defendant   No.1/respondent \n\n\n\nNo.1 herein Andivelu has also not supported the case of the \n\n\n\nplaintiff that the half share of appellant/Rangammal in the \n\n\n\ndisputed   property     was   sold   out   vide   sale   deed   dated \n\n\n\n24.2.1951   for   legal   necessity   without   permission   of   the \n\n\n\nCourt and hence  defendant No.1/respondent No.2 also has\n17\nnot supported  the  case  of the  plaintiff/respondent  No.1  on \n\n\n\nthis count.\n16.             The   plaintiff/respondent   No.1   therefore   has \n\n\n\nmiserably  failed to prove his case as per his pleading in the \n\n\n\nplaint   and   the   burden   to   prove   that   the   sale   deed   in   fact \n\n\n\nwas   valid   has   not   even   been   cast   on   plaintiff/respondent \n\n\n\nNo.1 that the share of appellant-Rangammal had been sold \n\n\n\nout by Kumara Naicker vide sale deed  dated  24.2.1951 for \n\n\n\nconsideration   without   permission   of   the   Court   when   the \n\n\n\nappellant was a minor.\n17.             The   High   Court,   therefore,     has   fallen   into   an \n\n\n\nerror   while  observing  that  the  appellant/defendant   No.2  in \n\n\n\nthe suit  should have assailed the sale deed and  cannot do \n\n\n\nso  after 31 years of its execution when it is unambiguously \n\n\n\nan          admitted         factual         position         that         it         is         the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent  No.1  who had  filed a suit for partition \n\n\n\nagainst his brother defendant No.1/respondent No.2 and in \n\n\n\nthat   partition   suit     it   was     plaintiff/respondent   No.1   who \n\n\n\nbanked upon the story  that a sale deed had been executed \n\n\n\nby his Uncle Kumara Naicker who claimed it to be the legal \n\n\n\nguardian of the appellant-Rangammal who admittedly was a\n18\nminor for legal necessity which was to discharge the debt of \n\n\n\nthe appellant's deceased mother.   Hence, in view of\nSection \n\n\n\n101\nof   the   Indian   Evidence   Act,   1872   it   is   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1     who   should   have   first   of   all \n\n\n\ndischarged   the   burden     that  in    fact   a  sale   deed  had   been \n\n\n\nexecuted   for   the   share   which   admittedly   belonged   to \n\n\n\nappellant-Rangammal   in   order   to   discharge   the   burden   of \n\n\n\ndebt for legal necessity and for the benefit of the appellant \n\n\n\nwho admittedly was a minor.\n18.          When the plaintiff-respondent  No.1-Kuppuswami \n\n\n\ncame with a specific pleading for the first time in a partition \n\n\n\nsuit  that the appellant's share had been sold out by her de  \n\n\n\nfacto guardian Kumara Naicker without even the permission \n\n\n\nof     the   court,   it   was   clearly   the   plaintiff/respondent   No.1 \n\n\n\nwho should have discharged the burden that the same was \n\n\n\ndone for legal necessity   of the minor in order to discharge \n\n\n\nthe   debt   which   the   deceased   mother   of   the   appellant   was \n\n\n\nalleged   to   have   been   owing     to   some   one.     When   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   failed   to   discharge     this   burden, \n\n\n\nthe   question   of   discharge   of   burden     to   disprove     the   sale \n\n\n\ndeed     by   the   2nd  defendant/appellant-Rangammal   do   not\n19\narise  at all as per the provisions of\nEvidence Act\n.  It may be \n\n\n\nrelevant at this stage to cite  the ratio of the decision of this \n\n\n\nCourt     delivered   in   the   matter   of\nSubhra   Mukherjee  vs. \n\n\n\nBharat   Coaking   Coal   Ltd\n,   AIR   2000   SC   1203,  whether   the \n\n\n\ndocument in question was genuine   or sham   or bogus, the \n\n\n\nparty who  alleged it to be bogus had to prove nothing until \n\n\n\nthe   party   relying     upon     the   document   established       its \n\n\n\ngenuineness.\nThis  was the view expressed by this Court in \n\n\n\nthe   matter   of\nSubhra   Mukherjee  vs.  Bharat   Coaking   Coal  \n\n\n\nLtd\n,  AIR   2000   SC   1203   =   2000   (3)   SCC   312.\nThis   case \n\n\n\nalthough did not relate   to a suit   for partition or question \n\n\n\nrelating   to   minority,     it   was   a   case   wherein   the   appellant \n\n\n\nrefused   to   hand   over   possession   of   property   to   the \n\n\n\nrespondent-government   company     when   ordered   to   do   so.\nInstead she filed a suit for declaration of  title in respect of \n\n\n\nproperty.     The   evidence   of   plaintiff/appellant   indicated \n\n\n\nseveral     discrepancies     and   inconsistencies     due   to   which \n\n\n\nthe trial court dismissed the suit but the 1st appellate court \n\n\n\nand     the   High   Court,     had   allowed   the   appeal   which   was \n\n\n\nupheld by the Supreme Court  as it was  held  that the High \n\n\n\nCourt   rightly   allowed   the   respondent's/government\n20\ncompany's second appeal and rightly found that the sale in \n\n\n\nfavour of the appellant was not bona fide   and thus confer \n\n\n\nno  rights on them.\n19.           Application   of\nSection   101\nof   the   Evidence   Act, \n\n\n\n1872 thus came up for discussion in this matter and while \n\n\n\ndiscussing the law on the burden of proof in the context of \n\n\n\ndealing   with     the   allegation   of       sham   and   bogus \n\n\n\ntransaction, it was held that   party which makes allegation \n\n\n\nmust   prove   it.     But   the   court   was   further   pleased   to   hold \n\n\n\nwherein   the     question   before   the   court   was   \"whether     the \n\n\n\ntransaction in question   was a bona fide and genuine one\"\nso that the party/plaintiff relying  on the transaction had to \n\n\n\nfirst of all prove  its genuineness and only  thereafter would \n\n\n\nthe defendant  be required to discharge the burden in order \n\n\n\nto   dislodge   such   proof   and   establish     that   the   transaction \n\n\n\nwas   sham   and   fictitious.     This   ratio     can   aptly     be   relied \n\n\n\nupon     in   this   matter   as   in   this   particular   case,   it   is   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1-Kuppuswami     who   relied   upon \n\n\n\nthe   alleged   sale   deed   dated   24.2.1951   and   included   the \n\n\n\nsubject-matter of the property which formed part of the sale \n\n\n\ndeed and claimed partition.   This sale deed  was denied by\n21\nthe   defendant/appellant   on   the   ground   that   it   was   bogus \n\n\n\nand   a  sham transaction  which   was  executed  admittedly   in \n\n\n\n1951   when   she   was   a   minor.                Thus,   it   was   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   who   should   have   first   of   all \n\n\n\ndischarged   the   burden   that   the   sale   deed   executed   during \n\n\n\nthe minority of the appellant  was  genuine and was fit to be \n\n\n\nrelied upon.   If the courts below   including the High Court \n\n\n\nhad   felt   satisfied     on   this   aspect,     only   then     the   burden \n\n\n\ncould   be     shifted   on   the   defendant/appellant   to     dislodge \n\n\n\nthe case  of the plaintiff  that the sale deed was not genuine.\nBut   when   the   plaintiff   merely     pleaded   in   the   plaint     but \n\n\n\nfailed  to lead any evidence - much   less proof, that the sale \n\n\n\ndeed   was   genuine   and   was   executed   in   order   to   discharge \n\n\n\nthe burden of legal necessity  in the interest of  minor, then \n\n\n\nthe   High   Court     clearly   misdirected   itself     by   recording   in \n\n\n\nthe   impugned   order   that   it   is   the   defendant/appellant \n\n\n\nherein who should  have challenged  the genuineness of the \n\n\n\nsale   deed   after   attaining   majority   within   the   period   of \n\n\n\nlimitation.\n20.            Since  the  High  Court  has  misplaced    burden  of \n\n\n\nproof,   it   clearly   vitiated   its   own   judgments   as   also   of   the\n22\ncourts   below  since   it   is   well   established   dictum   of   the\nEvidence Act\nthat misplacing  burden of proof would vitiate \n\n\n\njudgment.       It is also equally   and undoubtedly   true that \n\n\n\nthe burden of proof may not be of much consequence  after \n\n\n\nboth   the   parties     lay   evidence,   but   while     appreciating   the \n\n\n\nquestion of  burden of proof, misplacing of  burden of proof \n\n\n\non a particular party and recording  findings in a particular \n\n\n\nway definitely  vitiates the judgment  as it has happened in \n\n\n\nthe   instant   matter.     This   position   stands   reinforced     by \n\n\n\nseveral authorities   including the one   delivered in the case \n\n\n\nof    Koppula     Koteshwara   Rao  vs.    Koppula   Hemant   Rao,  \n\n\n\n2002 AIHC 4950 (AP).\n21.          It has been further held  by the Supreme Court in \n\n\n\nthe case   of   State  of J & K  vs.  Hindustan  Forest Company,  \n\n\n\n2006 (12) SCC 198, wherein  it was held that the onus is on \n\n\n\nthe plaintiff  to positively   establish its case on the basis of \n\n\n\nmaterial   available   and   it   cannot   rely   on   the   weakness   or \n\n\n\nabsence of defence to discharge onus.\n22.          It   was     still   further   held     by   this   Court   in   the \n\n\n\nmatter of\nCorporation  of City  of Bangalore  vs.  Zulekha   Bi\n,  \n\n\n\n2008 (11) SCC 306 (308)  that it is for the plaintiff   to prove\n23\nhis   title   to   the   property.     This   ratio   can   clearly   be   made \n\n\n\napplicable  to the facts of this case for it is the plaintiff who \n\n\n\nclaimed title to the  property  which was a subject-matter of \n\n\n\nthe alleged sale deed of 24.2.1951 for which  he had sought \n\n\n\npartition   against   his  brother   and,  therefore,     it  was   clearly \n\n\n\nthe plaintiff who should have first of all established his case \n\n\n\nestablishing   title   of   the     property   to   the   joint   family   out   of \n\n\n\nwhich     he   was   claiming   his   share.     When   the   plaintiff \n\n\n\nhimself failed to discharge the burden to prove that the sale \n\n\n\ndeed   which   he   executed     in   favour   of   his   own   son   and \n\n\n\nnephew     by     selling   the   property     of   a  minor   of   whom     he \n\n\n\nclaimed   to   be   legal   guardian     without   permission   of   the \n\n\n\ncourt,   it was clearly   fit to be set aside by the High Court \n\n\n\nwhich   the     High   Court     as   also   the   courts   below     have \n\n\n\nmiserably  failed to discharge.  The onus was clearly on the \n\n\n\nplaintiff     to   positively   establish     his   case     on   the   basis     of \n\n\n\nmaterial available   and could not have been allowed by the \n\n\n\nHigh Court to rely on the weakness   or absence   of defence \n\n\n\nof  the defendant/appellant herein to discharge  such onus.\n23.           The   courts   below   thus   have   illegally   and \n\n\n\nerroneously   failed   not   to   cast   this   burden   on   the\n24\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   by   clearly   misconstruing   the \n\n\n\nwhole   case   and   thus   resulted   into   recording   of   findings \n\n\n\nwhich   are   wholly   perverse   and   even   against   the   admitted \n\n\n\ncase of the parties.\n24.          It   is   further   well-settled   that   a   suit     has   to   be \n\n\n\ntried on the basis of the pleadings  of the contesting parties \n\n\n\nwhich is filed   in the suit before the trial court in the form \n\n\n\nof     plaint   and   written   statement   and   the   nucleus     of   the \n\n\n\ncase   of   the   plaintiff     and   the   contesting   case   of   the \n\n\n\ndefendant   in the form of issues emerges out of   that.   This \n\n\n\nbasic  principle,  seems to have been missed not only by the \n\n\n\ntrial   court     in   this   case   but   consistently   by   the   first \n\n\n\nappellate   court   which   has   been     compounded   by   the   High \n\n\n\nCourt.\n25.          Thus, we are of the view,  that the whole case out \n\n\n\nof which   this  appeal arises had been  practically made  a \n\n\n\nmess  by  missing  the  basic     principle     that the  suit  should \n\n\n\nbe     decided   on   the   basis   of   the   pleading   of   the   contesting \n\n\n\nparties   after  which\nSection  101\nof The  Evidence  Act  would \n\n\n\ncome  into play  in  order   to determine  on  whom  the  burden \n\n\n\nfalls for proving the issues which have been determined.\n25\n26.          We   further   fail   to   comprehend   as   to   how   the \n\n\n\nbasic   case   pleaded   by   the   plaintiff   had   been   misconstrued \n\n\n\nand   the   burden   of   discharge   of   genuineness,   veracity   and \n\n\n\nlegal   efficacy of the sale deed dated 24.2.1951 was shifted \n\n\n\non the appellant-Rangammal   clearly missing   that it is the \n\n\n\nplaintiff's/respondent   No.1   case   who   was   bent   upon   to \n\n\n\ninclude   Rangammal's   property   also   for   partition   by   relying \n\n\n\nupon the story of execution of sale deed  when the partition \n\n\n\nsuit     was   between   the   two   brothers     who   were   plaintiff-\nKuppuswami and defendant No.1-Andivelu.\n27.          Coming now to the next question, we are unable \n\n\n\nto   appreciate   as  to   how  the   High   Court     has  held  that  the \n\n\n\ndelay   in   challenging   the     sale   deed   of   1951   should   have \n\n\n\nbeen   done   at   the   instance   of   the   2nd  defendant-appellant \n\n\n\nherein     when   it   is   the   plaintiff     who   brought   the \n\n\n\ntheory/story   of     execution   of     the   sale   deed     of   appellant \n\n\n\nRangammal's             property         into         the         branch         of \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondents'     branch   by   pleading   and   asserting \n\n\n\nthat  this had fallen into the share of  their predecessor  as \n\n\n\none of the predecessors was the  de facto  guardian     of   the \n\n\n\nappellant Rangammal.  In fact, if there was a dispute about\n26\nthe   genuineness   and   veracity   of   the   sale   deed   and   the \n\n\n\nappellant   was   in   occupation   of   her   share,   then   it   is   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff  who should  have filed  a suit claiming title on the \n\n\n\nbasis   of     the   sale   deed   which   was   claimed   to   have       been \n\n\n\nexecuted   in   their   favour   by   the  de   facto    guardian   of \n\n\n\nRangammal   when   she   was   a   minor   before   this   property \n\n\n\ncould   be   included   in   the   suit   for   partition   between   the \n\n\n\nbrothers excluding the 2nd  defendant/appellant Rangammal \n\n\n\nand   the     consequence   of   not   doing   so   or   delay   in   this \n\n\n\nregard,   obviously   will   have   to   be   attributed   to   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent.\n28.           Thus, the High Court fell into a clear error when \n\n\n\nit observed that the suit was barred by limitation as it had \n\n\n\nbeen   filed   after   31   years   of   the   execution   of   the   sale   deed \n\n\n\nwhich   on   the   face   of   it   is   factually   incorrect.     The   High \n\n\n\nCourt has clearly erred while recording   so,   as it seems to \n\n\n\nhave     missed   that   the     suit   had   not   been   filed   by   the \n\n\n\nappellant herein  but she was merely contesting the suit as \n\n\n\nthe   2nd  defendant   by   getting   herself   impleaded   in   the \n\n\n\npartition   suit   when   it   came   to   her   knowledge   that   the \n\n\n\nproperty   which   is     in   her   occupation   and   possession   has\n27\nalso been included in the schedule in the suit   for partition \n\n\n\nbetween   plaintiff/respondent   No.1   herein-Kuppuswamy \n\n\n\nand   the   1st  defendant/respondent   No.2   herein-Andivelu \n\n\n\nand when she received   the copy of the plaint, execution of \n\n\n\nthe   alleged   sale   deed   way   back   in   1951   was     disclosed   to \n\n\n\nher for the first time.   Hence, there was no cause of action \n\n\n\nfor   her     to   file   a   suit   challenging   the   alleged   sale   deed   as \n\n\n\nknowledge   of   the   same   cannot   be   attributed   to   her   in   this \n\n\n\nregard   as   she     asserted   actual   physical   possession   on   her \n\n\n\nshare.\n29.           The   appellant   who   claimed   to   be   in   occupation \n\n\n\nand peaceful possession of   her share   to the extent of half \n\n\n\nwhich   is   situated   on   the   eastern     side   of   the   schedule \n\n\n\nproperty,   had   no     reason   to   file   a   suit   assailing     the   sale \n\n\n\ndeed   when   she   was   in   actual   physical   possession   of   her \n\n\n\nshare   and   suddenly   out   of   the   blue,   a   partition   suit     was \n\n\n\nfiled by  the  plaintiff/respondent  No.1 wherein the property \n\n\n\nof   the   appellant   also   was   included   in   the   schedule   of   the \n\n\n\npartition suit which was to be partitioned  between the two \n\n\n\nbrothers by metes and bounds by setting a cooked up story \n\n\n\nthat   the   appellant's   share,   who   belonged   to   an   altogether\n28\ndifferent branch of the family, had been   given away by her \n\n\n\nde facto guardian Kumara Naicker by executing a sale deed \n\n\n\nin   favour   of   the   respondents'   predecessor   way   back   on \n\n\n\n24.2.1951 when the appellant admittedly was  a minor.\n30.          We are, therefore,  constrained to  partly set aside \n\n\n\nthe  judgment  and  order  of  the  High Court   in so  far   as  the \n\n\n\nshare   of   the   appellant   Rangammal   is   concerned   and \n\n\n\nconsequently  the  decree  passed   by  the   trial   court,  upheld \n\n\n\nby   the   first   appellate   court   and   the   High   Court   which   had \n\n\n\nbeen illegally decreed   including the share   of the appellant\n-Rangammal   which   had   not   devolved   on   the   family   of   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff/respondent   No.1   and   defendant   No.1/respondent \n\n\n\nNo.2,   but   was   claimed   on   the   basis   of   a   sale   deed   which \n\n\n\ncould not be proved either by evidence or law, is fit to be set \n\n\n\naside.\n31.          It hardly needs to be   highlighted   that  in   a suit \n\n\n\nfor partition, it is   expected of the plaintiff   to include only \n\n\n\nthose properties for partition to which the family has clear \n\n\n\ntitle and unambiguously  belong to the members of the joint \n\n\n\nfamily   which   is   sought   to   be   partitioned   and   if   someone \n\n\n\nelse's     property     meaning   thereby     disputed   property     is\n29\nincluded   in the  schedule  of  the  suit for partition,  and the \n\n\n\nsame   is   contested   by   a   third   party   who   is   allowed   to   be \n\n\n\nimpleaded   by   order   of   the   trial   court,   obviously   it   is   the \n\n\n\nplaintiff who will have to first of  all discharge the burden of \n\n\n\nproof     for     establishing   that   the   disputed   property   belongs \n\n\n\nto   the   joint     family   which   should   be   partitioned   excluding \n\n\n\nsomeone   who   claims   that   some   portion   of   the   joint   family \n\n\n\nproperty   did   not   belong   to   the   plaintiff's   joint   family   in \n\n\n\nregard to which decree for partition is sought.\n32.              However, we make it clear that the decree which \n\n\n\nhas   been   passed   by   the   trial   court   in   so   far   as   partition \n\n\n\nbetween           plaintiff/respondent          No.1         and         defendant \n\n\n\nNo.1/respondent   No.2   is   concerned,   shall   remain   in   tact \n\n\n\nbut   the   said   decree   shall   exclude   the   property   which   had \n\n\n\nfallen   into   the   share   of     appellant-Rangammal   but   was \n\n\n\nclaimed   to   have   been   transferred     to   the   branch   of     the \n\n\n\nplaintiff   and   1st  defendant-respondents   herein   vide   sale \n\n\n\ndeed     dated   24.2.1951     The   trial   court   being   the   court   of \n\n\n\nDistrict Munsif, Palani, accordingly shall modify the decree \n\n\n\npassed   in   O.S.   No.255   of   1982   by   excluding     the   share   of \n\n\n\nthe appellant -Rangammal claimed on the basis of the sale\n30\ndeed dated 24.2.1951.   Thereafter,   if the decree   is put to \n\n\n\nexecution,   the   executing   court     shall   ensure   that   such \n\n\n\nportion     of   the   property   which   is   in   occupation     of \n\n\n\nRangammal   which   was   alleged  to   have   been  sold  vide   sale \n\n\n\ndeed dated 24.2.1951, shall not be put into execution while \n\n\n\npartitioning   the   remaining   property   between   the   plaintiff-\nKuppuswami   and   1st  defendant   -Andivelu   -   respondent \n\n\n\nNo.2.\n33.          Thus,   this   appeal   in   so   far   as   the   claim     of   the \n\n\n\nappellant- Rangammal to the  extent  of half of the share in \n\n\n\nthe   schedule   to   the   suit   property,   situated   on   the   eastern \n\n\n\nportion   is   concerned,   stands   allowed   with   a   token   cost \n\n\n\nwhich   is   quantified     at   rupees  twenty   five   thousand   as   we \n\n\n\nare   of   the   view   that   the   appellant   who   was   in   actual \n\n\n\nphysical and peaceful possession of her property which she \n\n\n\nhad inherited from her deceased parents, was unnecessarily \n\n\n\ndragged into this litigation at the instance of   the plaintiff-\nKuppuswami   who   filed   a   partition   suit     which   was \n\n\n\napparently collusive in nature as it included the share of a \n\n\n\nthird party to which the plaintiff and 1st  defendant's family \n\n\n\nhad   no   clear   title.         Under   the   facts   and   circumstance   of\n31\nthe instant case, it was clearly a compulsion on the part of \n\n\n\nthe appellant/Tmt. Rangammal to contest the collusive suit \n\n\n\nfor   decades   Kwasting   time,   energy   and   expense   over   a \n\n\n\nlitigation  which  was  started by the plaintiff  clearly  with  an \n\n\n\noblique motive and evil design. Hence the cost shall be paid \n\n\n\nby   the   respondent   No.1-Kuppuswami   to   the   appellant-\nRangammal as indicated above.\n34.         Accordingly,   this   appeal   stands   allowed   with \n\n\n\ncosts.\n..................................J\n\n                                           (J.M.

J.\nThis appeal  is directed  against the  Judgment of\t the\nMadhya Pradesh\tHigh Court  in a proceeding under\nSection 30\nof the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as 'the\nAct'). A  property measuring  25.12  acres  appertaining  to\nsurvey nos.  70 and  71 in  village Narwal  in the  District\nlndore\thad   been  purchased  from  one  Mithulal  under  a\nregistered Sale\t Deed in  the  year  1961  in  the  name  of\nappellant  Surendra  Kumar  by\tgrand  father  Chhogalal  as\nguardian. The  said property was acquired for the industrial\narea Indore  and the  Land Acquisition\tCollector passed  an\naward  on   5.3.1966  under\nSection  11\nof  the  Act\t and\ncompensation of\t Rs.99,373/- was  granted to  the appellant.\nSubsequent to  the passing  of\tthe  award  the\t respondents\nappeared before\t the Land  Acquisition Collector and claimed\nthat the  property in  question is joint family property and\nthey are  entitled to  share in it. Dispute having arisen to\nthe apportionment  of the compensation, the Land Acquisition\nCollector referred the dispute for the decision to the Court\nunder\nSection  30\nof  the Act.\tBefore\tthe  Ld.  Additional\nDistrict Judge\tit was\tcontended on behalf of the appellant\nthat the  land in  question has\t been purchased\t in his name\nfrom out of his funds though his grand father Chhogalal\nacted as  his guardian\tand therefore  the  same  cannot  be\ntreated to  be joint  family property.It  was also contended\nthat Ramchandra\t one of\t the claimants\thad filed a suit for\npartition of  the joint family property which was registered\nas Civil  Suit No.  51/53 and  in  that\t suit  the  disputed\nproperty had  not been\tincluded and present claim therefore\nis barred  by the  provisions of\nOrder II Rule 2 C.P.C\n. The\nalternative contention\talso have  been raised\ton behalf of\nthe appellant  to the  fact that Phoolchand had relinquished\nhis interest  in the  joint family  property by\t executing a\nrelease deed in favour of Chhogalal and consequently he also\nrelinquished his  share\t in  the  compensation\tamount.\t The\nrespondents on\tthe other  hand contended  that the property\nhas been purchased by Chhogalal in the name of the appellant\nfrom out  of the funds of the joint family, and as such they\nare entitled to 1/3 share in the compensation amount. lt was\nalso pleaded  that the\tso called  release deed\t is null and\nvoid  and   non-operative  and\t is  not  binding.  The\t Ld.\nAdditional District  Judge on  thorough consideration of the\nmatter before  him came\t to the\t conclusion  that  Chhogalal\ngrand father of appellant - Surendra Kumar was managing the\naffairs of  the business  of the  Joint Hindu Family and the\nJoint Family  had sufficient  funds to\tpurchase the land in\nquestion. He  also found  that the  earlier  partition\tsuit\nhaving been filed in the year 1953 and the disputed property\nhaving been purchased only in the year 1961, the same could\nnot have  been included\t in the\t suit for partition and such\nnon inclusion  is not  fatal to\t the case of the respondents\nand\nOrder  II Rule  2 C.P.C\n.  has no  applications.  On\t the\nquestion as  to whether\t the  property\tis  a  joint  family\nproperty or  not, it  was found that consideration money for\npurchasing the\tproperty had been paid by Chhogalal from out\nof the Joint Hindu Family funds and as such it was the joint\nfamily\tproperty.   The\t plea  of  the\tappellant  that\t the\nConsideration money was in fact paid by appellant's maternal\ngrand father  was rejected as the appellant failed to adduce\nsufficient evidence  on that  score. With  these findings it\nwas directed  that the\tappellant as well as the respondents\nwould be  entitle for  1/3 share  each in  the\tcompensation\namount. The  aforesaid judgment\t of the Addl. District Judge\nin Miscellaneous judicial Case No. 9 of 1973 was assailed in\nappeal which was registered as First appeal No. 59/1977. The\nHigh  Court   re-appreciated  the  evidence  on\t record\t and\naffirmed the  findings of  the\tLd.  Addl.  District  Judge.\nBearing in  mind the  correct legal  position with regard to\nthe  presumption  of  joint  interest  to  the\tproperty  in\nquestion the High Court scrutinized the evidence and came to\nthe conclusion\tthat land  in question\twas the joint family\nproperty. The  court also  came to  conclusion that the Sale\nDeed in\t favour of the appellant having been executed in the\nyear 1961,  non inclusion  of the  property in\tthe  earlier\npartition suit\tof 1953\t cannot be  held to  be fatal to the\npresent proceedings.  The Court\t also further  held that the\nappellant having  raised the  plea  that  the  consideration\nmoney for the land was paid by the maternal grand father and\nhaving failed  to establish  the same and no material having\nbeen produced  to establish  that the property was purchased\nout of\tthe  funds  of\tthe  appellant,\t the  conclusion  is\nirresistible that  it is  the joint  family property and has\nbeen purchased\tby Chhogalal the manager of the joint family\nproperty in the name of grand son the present appellant and\nconsequently the property is the joint family property. With\nthese conclusions  the appeal  having  been  dismissed,\t the\npresent appeal has been preferred.\nThe  learned counsel appearing for the appellant argued\nwith force  that though\t the sale  deed was  executed in the\nyear 1961  but the  property was  in possession of Chhogalal\nsince 1951  arld even  though the respondents knew about the\nsame yet the property was not included the earlier partition\nsuit filed  in the year 1953 and therefore the provisions of\norder II\nRule 2 C.P.C\n. . must be attracted. Alternatively he\nargued that  at any  rate by 1966 the respondent having come\nto know about the existence of the property and at that time\nthe appeal against the judgment in Civil Suit No. 51/53 have\nbeen pending and yet the property not having been sought to-\nbe brought  over in  the appeal, it must be assumed that the\npresent claim  is mere\tafter thought.\tLastly, the  learned\ncounsel contested the finding that the property is the joint\nfamily property\t and rejection\tof the case of the appellant\nthat the  consideration money  was paid\t by  maternal  grand\nfather\tis   wholly  unsustainable  in\tlaw  and  is  merely\narbitrary and,\ttherefore, this\t court would be justified in\nreversing the  finding with  regard to\tthe jointness of the\nproperty.\nLearned counsel  for the  respondent on  the other hand\ncondended that two courts below having examined the relevant\nMaterials in  its proper perspective and having recorded the\nfinding that  the property  is the joint family property, it\nwould not  be appropriate  for this  court to interfere with\nthe same particularly when no question to law arises in this\nregard. The  learned counsel also contended that the earlier\nsuit filed by one of the respondents being in the year 1953,\nand at\tthat point  of time  the property  not\thaving\tbeen\npurchased, the\tquestion of  inclusion of  the same  in\t the\nearlier suit did not arise and consequently the courts below\nrightly held  that the\tnon inclusion  cannot be  held to be\nfatal to the present suit.\nIn vies  of rival\tcontentions,  two  questions  really\narise for our consideration:\n1) Whether\t non inclusion\tof the\tdisputed property in\nthe earlier  partition suit  will  in  any  way\t affect\t the\npresent proceedings  by\t application  of\nOrder\t II  Rule  2\nC.P.C\n.?.\n2) Whether\t the findings of the two courts below on the\nquestion that the property is a joint family property can at\nall be interfered by this Court?\nSo far  as the  first  question  is  concerned  on\t the\nadmitted position  that the  sale deed\tin the\tname of\t the\nappellant was  executed only  in the  year 1961 and the suit\nfor partition of the Joint Family property by Ramchandra had\nbeen filed  in the  year 1953,\tthe said  property could not\nhave been included in the partition suit and therefore non\ninclusion of  the property  is\tnot  fatal  to\tthe  present\nproceedings. In\t our considered\t opinion the  provisions  of\nOrder II  Rule 2  C.p.C. cannot\t be applied to the facts and\ncircumstances of  the present  case. In\t this connection  it\nwill be appropriate to consider the contention raised by the\nlearned counsel\t for the appellant that the respondents came\nto know\t about the  property  when  they  filed\t application\nbefore the Land Acquisition Authority and still they did not\napproach  the\tappellate  forum  in  the  Civil  Court\t for\ninclusion of  the property  and on that score they would not\nbe allowed  to agitate\tin the\tpresent proceeding.  We\t are\nafraid this  submission does not have any substance.That the\nproperty having\t been acquired and an award has been passed,\nany claim  in respect  of the  said compensation  amount can\nonly  be   made\t by   raising  a  dispute  before  the\tland\nacquisition authority  and that has been done in the present\ncase. We  also do  not find  any material  in support of the\ncontention raised  on behalf  of the learned counsel for the\nappellant that\tthe respondents\t must be  presumed  to\thave\nknowledge about the purchase of the property since Chhogalal\nwas in\tpossession of the same since l951. We have carefully\nscrutinized the\t material on  record and we do not find iota\nof evidence  in support\t of the aforesaid contention. In the\naforesaid premises  the irresistible  conclusion is that non\ninclusion of  the disputed property in the earlier partition\nsuit does  not in  any way affect the present proceeding and\ntherefore in  a reference  under\nSection  30\nof  the\tLand\nAcquisition Act\t the Court  was fully  justified in deciding\nthe question  as to  whether the  property is  joint  family\nproperty or  is the self acquired property of the appellant.\nThe provisions of\nOrder II Rule 2 C.P.C\n. has no application.\nComing to\tthe second  question it\t is an admitted fact\nthat Chhogalal\twas the\t eldest member of the family and was\nthe manager  of the  Joint family  consisting of  Chhogalal,\nRamchandra and\tPhoolchand. The\t agreement to sale is stated\nto have\t been made  in the year 1951 and consideration money\nhad been  paid in  1951 and  1952 and  finally sale deed was\nexecuted in the year l961. At that point of time the present\nappellant  was\ta  minor  and  the  property  was  therefore\npurchased in  the name\tof the\tminor with  Chhogalal as the\nguardian. In  course of\t the proceedings appellant has taken\nthe specific plea that the consideration money had been paid\nby his maternal grand father and that plea has been rejected\nby the\tcourts below  on consideration\tof material with the\nfinding that the appellant has failed to establish the same.\nThus there  is no  material to\testablish that consideration\nmoney for the property was paid by the appellant from out of\nhis separate  funds. It\t is no\tdoubt true  that there is no\npresumption that  a family  because it\tis  joint  possessed\njoint  property\t  and  therefore  the  person  alleging\t the\nproperty to  be joint  has to  establish that the family was\npossessed of  some property  with the  income of  which\t the\nproperty could have been at required. But such a presumption\nis a presumption of fact which can be rebutted. But where it\nis established\tor admitted  that the family which possessed\njoint property\twhich from its nature and relative value may\nhave formed sufficient nucleus from which the property in\nquestion may have been acquired, the presumption arises that\nit was the joint property and the burden shifts to the party\nalleging self  acquisition to  establish affirmatively\tthat\nthe property  was acquired  without the\t aid  of  the  joint\nfamily. Both  the courts below have scrutinized the evidence\nbearing in  mind  the  aforesaid  legal\t position  and\thave\nrightly come to the conclusion that the property in question\nis the\tjoint family  property. We  see no justification for\nour interference  with the  said concurrent  findings of the\ntwo courts  below. The\tappreciation of\t evidence  has\tbeen\nrightly made bearing in mind the correct legal position. The\nappellant thus\thas utterly  failed to\testablish  that\t the\nconsideration money  for the  property was  paid out  of his\npersonal funds.In  the aforesaid circumstances agreeing with\nthe two courts below we hold that the property was the joint\nfamily property and therefore the respondents have 1/3 share\neach in\t the compensation  amount. In the aforesaid premises\nthis appeal  is devoid of merits and the same is accordingly\ndismissed but in the circumstances without any\norder as to costs.",

Ganapathi and Ganpat Rai, with  him)\t for\nrespondent No. 1.\n1954.  April 15.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMUKHERJEA J.-This appeal arises out of a suit, commenced  by\nthe plaintiff respondent, in the Court of the District Judge\nof  Bellary,  being  Original  Suit  No.  17  of  1944,\t for\nestablishment  of  his title to one-half share of  the\tland\ndescribed in the schedule to the plaint and for recovery  of\npossession of the same after partition with defendant No. 1,\nwho  is the appellant before us.  The suit was dismissed  by\nthe  trial  Judge by his judgment dated the  23rd  of  July,\n1945.  On an appeal being taken against that decision by the\nplaintiff  to the High Court of Madras, a Division Bench  of\nthe  High  -Court by its judgment dated the 28th  of  March,\n1949,  allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment  of\t the\ntrial Court., The defendant No. 1 has now come up on  appeal\nto  this Court on the strength of a certificate\t granted  by\nthe  High Court under\narticle 133\nof the  Constitution\tread\nwith sections 109 and 1 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.\nTo  appreciate the contentions that have been raised  before\nus  it\tmay  be\t necessary to give a  short  resume  of\t the\nmaterial  facts.  The land in suit, which has an area  of  a\nlittle\tover  9 acres, was admittedly the  property  of\t one\nBasappa\t who  died  some time  before  1918,  leaving  three\ndaughters,  to wit Paramma, Pompamma and Hampamma.  Under  a\nsettlement  entered into with the immediate  reversioner  of\nBasappa which is evidenced by two registered  deeds-Exhibits\nP-2  and  P-3-executed respectively in the  years  1918\t and\n1919, the three sisters got about 15 to 16 acres of wet land\n133\nin absolute right.  Hampamma subsequently took away her one-\nthird share in these lands and we are not concerned with her\nany  further  in  this\tlitigation.   Paramma  and  Pompamma\ncontinued  to  enjoy the remaining two-thirds share  of\t the\nproperty and it is this two-thirds ,share comprising 9 acres\n49  cents of wet land which forms the subject-matter of\t the\npresent\t suit.\tPompamma married one Nagana Gowd  and  after\ngiving birth to two sons to wit Siddalingana and  Chenabasa-\nvana,  she died in the year 1923.  It is not  disputed\tthat\nher  share in the lands mentioned above devolved upon  these\ntwo sons.  After Pompamma's death, Nagana married again\t and\nstayed with his second wife in his ancestral village,  while\nthese two infant sons of Pompamma remained at village Kampli\nwith  Paramma, their mother's sister, who reared them up  as\nher  own sons.\tOn the 22nd June, 1923, Paramma\t executed  a\ndeed  of  gift in favour of the two sons of  her  sister  by\nwhich she conveyed to the latter her own share in the.\tsuit\nproperty.  The result was that the two sons of Pompamma\t got\nthe entirety of the 9 acres 49 cents of land which as  owned\njointly\t by their mother and their mother's sister  Paramma.\nShortly\t after this gift was made, Siddalingana,  the  elder\nson  of Pompamma, died in the year 1924 and the\t plaintiff's\ncase  is  that\this  half-share\t in  the  disputed  property\ndevolved  upon\this  father Nagkna under the  Hindu  law  of\ninheritance.  It is admitted however that Paramma  continued\nto possess the entirety of the land on behalf of the younger\nson Chenabasavana who is defendant No. 1 in the suit On\t the\n25th  August, 1946, there was a lease deed Exhibit D-1,\t and\nits  counter  part  Exhibit D-2,  executed  by\tand  between\nParamma\t on  the  one  hand and Nagana\tas  the\t father\t and\nguardian  of the infant Chenabasavana on the other by  which\nthe  infant represented by his father purported to  grant  a\nlease  of the entire property to Paramma for a period of  12\nyears  at  a rental of Rs. 500 a year.\t Two  rent  receipts\npassed\tby  Nagana  to Paramma in token of  the\t receipt  of\nrents,\treserved by this lease, on behalf  of  Chenabasavana\nhave  been proved in this case, Exhibits D-4 and  D4-1,\t and\nthey are of the years 1927 and 1932 respectively.\n134\nIt appears that in 1934 Nagana instituted a suit as guardian\nof  his\t infant son Chenabasavana in the Munsif's  Court  at\nHospet to recover a -sum of Rs. 500 as rent from Paramma  on\nthe  basis  of\tthe lease mentioned  above.   The  suit\t was\ndecreed ex parte and the decree was discharged later on by a\ndocument  Exhibit  D-3, dated the 14th\tof  November,  1934,\nexecuted by Nagana, which contains a recital that as Paramma\nhad borrowed much money to purchase lands for the minor, all\nfuture\trents  payable\tunder  the lease  were\talso  to  be\nconsidered  as\tfully  paid.   It is  in  evidence  and\t not\ndisputed,   that   near\t about\tthis  time   Nagana   became\nfinancially  involved  and on the 27th of August,  1935,  he\nexecuted  a deed of mortgage by conditional sale in  respect\nof  half-share of the disputed land in favour  of  defendant\nNo.  2\tto  secure an advance of Rs.  3,000.   The  document\nrecites\t that the half-share of the land which was kept\t as.\nsecurity devolved upon the mortgagor on the death of his son\nSiddalingana and \"that he was in possession of the same.  On\nthe 16th July, 1936, Nagana sold the mortgaged property by,a\ndeed  of sale (Exhibit P-6) to the mortgagee himself:  or  a\nconsideration  of Rs. 3,000 which was the principal sum\t due\nunder  the mortgage.  It is admitted that the purchaser\t did\nnot and could not obtain possession -of the property at\t any\ntime  since  then  and on the 2nd May,\t1944,  he  sold\t the\nproperty to the 'plaintiff by a conveyance which is  Exhibit\nP-1.   On  the 18th July, 1944, the  plaintiff\tbrought\t the\npresent\t suit against Chenabasavana as defendant No.  I\t for\nrecovery of a demarcated half-share of the disputed property\nafter  partition  with\tthe latter on the  strength  of\t the\npurchase mentioned above and his own vendor was impleaded as\ndefendant No. 2 in the suit.\nThe  suit was contested by defendant No. 1 and a  number  of\npleas  were  taken  by him in his  written  statement.\t The\nsubstantial defence put forward was of a two-fold character.\nIt  was contended in the first place that under the deed  of\ngift  executed by Paramma in favour of defendant No.  I\t and\nhis  deceased brother Siddalingana, the donees became  joint\ntenants\t with  rights of survivorship  Consequently  on\t the\ndeath of\n135\nSiddalingana his interest devolved upon defendant No. 1\t and\nnot on his father.  The other and the more material  defence\nraised\twas that the plaintiff's suit was barred, as he\t was\nnever in possession of the property and the defendant No.  1\nacquired  a  good title by adverse possession.\t Both  these\npoints\twere  decided against the plaintiff by\tthe  learned\nDistrict  Judge\t who tried the suit.  It was held  that\t the\ndeed  of  gift\texecuted by Paramma conferred  no  right  on\nNagana\tas the heir of his son and such rights if  any\twere\nspecifically disclaimed by Nagana by the lease deed and also\nby the receipts which he granted to Paramma as the  guardian\nof his minor son.  It was held further that the\t plaintiff's\nsuit was bound to fail as he or his predecessors were  never\nin possession of the property within 12 years from the\tdate\nof  the suit.  The plaintiff indeed was an alienee of a\t co-\ntenant\tbut  it was held that the ordinary rule of  one\t co-\nowner  being presumed to hold on behalf of the others  could\nnot  apply  to the present case., as Nagana  disclaimed\t his\nrights as a co-owner and purported to act only on behalf  of\nhis  infant son Chenabasavana whose exclusive title  to\t the\nlands he definitely acknowledged.  In view of these findings\nthe trial Judge dismissed the plaintiff's suit.\nThereupon   the\t plaintiff  took  an  appeal  against\tthis\n-decision  to  the High Court of Madras and the\t appeal\t was\nheard by a Division Bench consisting of Rajamannar C.J.\t and\nBalakrishna Ayyar J. The learned Judges held, differing from\nthe  trial Court, that the two sons of Pompamma\t took  their\nshares\tin their mother's property which devolved upon\tthem\nby  inheritance,  its  well as in the  property\t which\tthey\nobtained under the deed of gift executed in their favour  by\nParamma,  as tenants in common and not as joint tenants\t and\nconsequently  on  the  death of\t Siddalingana  his  interest\nvested\tin  his father Nagana and not in  his  brother,\t the\ndefendant  No. I. On the other question the High Court\theld\nthat  though.Nagana  by his acts and conduct  in  connection\nwith  the execution of the lease deed did exhibit an  animus\nto  hold the property solely on behalf of  Chenabasavana  to\nthe  exclusion\tof  himself, yet this animus  did  not\tlast\nbeyond 1935 when he\n136\nasserted his own right as a co-sharer to half-shire of\tthe-\nplaint property by executing the mortgage deed in favour  of\ndefendant No. 2. In these circumstances it was held that the\ndefendant No. 1 did not acquire title by adverse  possession\nand  the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.   The  defendant\nNo. 1 has now come up on appeal to this Court.\nMr.  Ayyangar  appearing in support of the  appeal  has\t not\npressed\t before us the contention that was raised on  behalf\nof his client in the Courts below, that as the two  brothers\ntook  the  property as joint tenants and not as\t tenants  in\ncommon, the interest of Siddalingana passed on his death  to\nhis  brother,  the defendant No. 1, and not to\tNagana.\t  We\nmust take it therefore that after the death of Siddalingana,\nNagana\tbecame a co-owner of the disputed property with\t his\nminor  son  Chenabasavana.   As the  plaintiff\tpurports  to\nderive\this  title  from  Nagana, he can  be  said  to\thave\nestablished his title as a co-owner with defendant No. I and\nthis  being  the position, the presumption of law  would  be\nthat  the  possession of one co-owner was on behalf  of\t the\nother  also unless actual ouster was proved.  To defeat\t the\nclaims\tof  the\t plaintiff therefore it\t is  incumbent\tupon\ndefendant No. I to prove that he held the property adversely\nto his co-owner -for the statutory period.  The\t peculiarity\nof  the\t present cage is that here the joint owners  of\t the\nproperty  were\tthe father and his infant son, of  whom\t the\nfather\thimself was the guardian and th e infant  could\t not\nact in law except through the guardian.\nIt is conceded on behalf of the appellant that the mere fact\nthat  the father did not participate in the profits  of\t the\nproperty  which\t was left to the management of\tParamrna  on\nbehalf of the infant could not by itself make the possession\nof the son adverse to his father.  But the acts and  conduct\nof the father in connection with the lease deed of 1926\t and\nthe  subsequent\t granting  of  receipts\t in  terms   thereof\nundoubtedly   point  to\t something  more  than\t mere\tnon-\nparticipation in the enjoyment of profits of the property on\nabsence of objection to the exclusive enjoyment there of  by\nParamma on behalf of the infant, In granting the\n137\nlease on behalf of the infant the father definitely asserted\nthe  exclusive\ttitle  of his son to  the  property  and  by\nimplication denied his own rights as a co-owner thereto.  In\nlaw  the possession of the lessee is the possession  of\t the\nlessor\tand consequently ever since 1926 when Paramma  began\nto  possess  the property as a lessee in terms of  the\tease\ndeed, her possession in law was the possession of the infant\nalone to the exclusion of Nagana, the father.  The fact that\nNagana consented to such exclusion is immaterial.  There can\nbe  in law, under certain circumstances, adverse  possession\nwith  the consent of the true owner.  A common\tillustration\nof  this rule is furnished 'by the class of cases where\t the\nlegal  owner  of a property transfers the  same\t to  another\nwithout\t the  requisite\t legal formalities  and\t though\t the\ntransferee  does  not  acquire a legal title to\t it  by\t the\ntransfer,  yet if he gets possession of the property  though\nwith  the consent of the transferor that possession  becomes\nadverse\t to  the owner and if continued\t for  the  statutory\nperiod creates a title in him. We are not satisfied from the\nmaterials  in  this  case that Nagana was  ignorant  of\t his\nrights\tas  heir of his deceased son when  he  executed\t the\nlease  in  the\tyear  1926., But even  if  he  was,  as\t the\nexclusive  possession of the infant was exercised  with\t the\nfull  knowledge\t and  consent  of  the\tfather\twho   openly\nacknowledged the title of his son, such possession could not\nbut  be\t adverse to the father.\t The learned Judges  of\t the\nHigh Court seem to be of the opinion that the possession  of\nthe minor could be regarded as adverse from the date of\t the\nexecution  of the lease, as the father by being a  party  to\nthe  said  document, did exhibit an animus  to\tpossess\t the\ncommon\tproperty  on  behalf  of  the  minor  alone  to\t the\nexclusion  of himself.\tBut according to the learned  Judges\nthis  animus ceased as soon as Nagana executed the  mortgage\ndeed  in  1935, asserting his right as, joint owner  of\t the\nproperty  in dispute and the adverse possession of  the\t son\nforthwith  came to an end.  With this view we are unable  to\nagree.\nOnce  it  is held that the, possession of  a  co-sharer\t has\nbecome adverse to the other co-sharer as a result of ouster,\nthe mere assertion of his joint title by the\n138\ndispossessed  co-sharer would not interrupt the\t running  of\nadverse possession.  He must actually and effectively  break\nup  the\t exclusive possession of his co-sharer\tby  re-entry\nupon  the property or by resuming possession in such  manner\nas it was possible to do.  It may also check the running  of\ntime  if  the  co-sharer  who  is  in  exclusive  possession\nacknowledges  the title of his coowner or  discontinues\t his\nexclusive  possession of the property.\tOn the materials  on\nthe  record, none of these things seems to have been  proved\nin  the present case.  Resumption of physical possession  or\nre-entry  upon\tthe  property  was  absolutely\tout  of\t the\nquestion, as the property was in the possession of a lessee.\nThe  lease, it should be noted, was executed in 1926 and  we\nhave   two  rent  receipts  of\tthe  years  1927  and\t1932\nrespectively by v which Nagana acknowledged receipt of rents\non behalf of his infant son in terms of the lease deed.\t The\nrent suit in 1934 was also brought by him in his capacity as\nguardian of defendant No. 1 and the document Exhibit D-3  by\nwhich  the decree in that suit was discharged and a  receipt\nwas  given  in advance for all the  subsequent\trents  point\ndefinitely  to the conclusion that the entire rent  for\t the\nwhole  period  of 12 years was paid to and was\taccepted  on\nbehalf of Chenabasavana and Nagana neither received any por-\ntion of it nor laid any claim to the same.  During the whole\nperiod\tof the lease and up to the present day the minor  is\nadmittedly  in\tpossession  of the property and\t no  act  or\nconduct on his part has been proved either within the period\nof limitation or even after that which might be regarded  as\nan  acknowledgment of the title of his father  as  co-owner.\nIn  our\t opinion the fact that the father  who\thad  allowed\nhimself to be dispossessed by his son exhibited later on his\nanimus\tto  treat  the property as  the\t joint\tproperty  of\nhimself\t and  his son cannot arrest the running\t of  adverse\npossession  in favour of the son.  A mere mental act on\t the\npart of the person dispossessed unaccompanied by any  change\nof  possession\tcannot\taffect\tthe  continuity\t of  adverse\npossession of the deseizor.\nThe  view  taken  by the High Court probably  rests  on\t the\nsupposition that as, it was the father, who, acting\n139\non  behalf of his son, asserted the exclusive title of\tthe-\nson to the property in denial of his own rights, it was open\nto  the\t father\t again if he so chose to  resile  from\tthat\nposition and make a fresh declaration that property was\t not\nthe  sole property of the son but belonged to him  as  well;\nand this subsequent act would annul the consequences of\t his\nprevious  act.\tThis reasoning does not appear to us  to  be\nsound.\tThe father's acts in connection with the lease\twere\nentirely in his capacity as guardian of his son.  In the eye\nof  the law they were the acts of the son, but the  creation\nof  the\t mortage in 1935 was not the act of  the  father  on\nbehalf\tof  his son, it was the personal act of\t the  father\nhimself qua co-proprietor of the son and the interest of one\nbeing adverse to the other such acts could not be held to be\nacts  of  the  son  performed through  the  father.   It  is\nextremely  doubtful  whether qua guardian the  father  could\nmake  such declaration at all.\tAny change of  intention  on\nthe  part of the guardian can be brought home to  the  minor\nthrough\t the  guardian alone and the minor can react  to  it\nagain  only through the guardian.  It may be proper in\tsuch\ncases for the father to renounce his guardianship before  he\ncould  assert any right of his own against his ward; but  it\nis  not\t necessary for us to go into that question,  as\t the\nmortgage  in  this  case was made by the father no  I  t  as\nguardian  of  the  minor  at all.  It was  no  more  than  a\ndeclaration,  by  a person who was dispossessed by  his\t co-\nsharer,\t of his joint title to the property and as has\tbeen\nalready\t pointed  out, as it did not involve any  change  of\npossession  it did not affect the adverse possession of\t the\ndeseizor.   In our opinion therefore the view taken  by\t the\nlearned Judges of the High Court is not proper and cannot be\nsustained.   The result is that the appeal is  allowed;\t the\n,judgment  and\tdecree of the High Court are set  aside\t and\nthose  of the District Judge restored.\tThe  appellant\twill\nhave his costs in all the Courts.\nAppeal allowed.\n140",

Respondent No. 1 till the integration of the States of Travancore and Cochin on 1st July, 1949 was the Ruler of the erstwhile State of Travancore and thereafter until the formation of the State of Kerala on 1st November, 1956 he was the Rajapramukh of the State of Travancore-Cochin. The suit was instituted by the appellant on the assertion that defendants 1 to 34 (respondent No. 1 being the defendant No. l in the suit) were members of the Travancore Royal Family. This family according to the appellant was an undivided marumakkathayam tarwad governed by Marumakkathayam Law as modified by custom and usage in respect of succession, inheritance and some other matters and that respondent No. l had been managing the properties of the tarwad in his capacity as its karnavan. According to him the properties in suit being tarwad properties were liable to be partitioned among the appellant and defendants 1 to 34 on per capita basis and the appellant was entitled to a 1/35 share. Some of the properties had been alienated by respondent, No. 1 but the appellant in place of challenging such alienations preferred to seek relief for accounting with regard to the proceeds of the alienations and for division of those proceeds among the members of the tarwad. He also prayed for a decree with regard to his share in the income of the tarwad properties which according to him were received by respondent No. l as karnavan. Some of the landed properties had been the subject-matter of the ceiling proceedings under the\nKerala Land Reforms Act, 1963\n. In those proceedings accepting the properties to be of respondent No. l the Kerala Land Board, Travancore by its order dated 15th February, 1972 declared excess lands liable to be surrendered to the Government. Against the aforesaid order the appellant filed a revision before the High Court which was dismissed on the ground of being belated. Thereupon the appellant made an application under\nSection 85(9)\nof the Land Reforms Act before the Land Board for setting aside its order dated 15th February, 1972 aforesaid. This petition was rejected by the Board on 7th August, 1978 and possession over the land declared to be excess was resumed by the Government. Against the order rejecting his application under\nSection 85(9)\nthe appellant filed a revision before the High Court which was disposed of on 11th September, 1979 reserving liberty to the appellant to move for relief under\nSection 85(9)\non the basis of the decision in A.S. No. 210 of 1979 as and when it was given. As noticed earlier A.S. No. 210 of 1979 was decided by the High Court on 8th October, 1982 by the judgment under appeal. The case of the appellant even with regard to the properties which were the subject-matter of the ceiling proceedings was that since they were tarwad properties they were to be treated as belonging to different families which constituted independent units in the tarwad and on that basis the tarwad was entitled to retain much larger area than the area which respondent No. 1 was found entitled to retain on the basis that these properties belonged to him.\n2. Respondent No. 1 contested the suit and filed a written statement. Even though it was not disputed that the appellant and defendants 1 to 34 were members of a family it was denied that they were members of an undivided marumakkathayam tarwad and that respondent No. 1 was the karnavan thereof. His case was that defendants 3 and 12 who were the two senior female members in the family and were junior and senior Maharanis of Travancore respectively along with their descendants formed a tarwad known as Sreepadam (the tarwad set up by the appellant in his plaint was, according to him, known as Valiakottaram). The case of respondent No. 1 further was that this Sreepadom tarwad known as the Royal Family of Travancore had its own properties which were divided per stirpes on 13th July, 1971 in two equal halves between the branch of defendant No. 3 on the one hand and of defendant No. 12 on the other. It was also asserted that the branch of defendant No. 12 made a further partition in which the appellant who was a member of that branch was given an individual share. According to Respondent No. 1 after the partition of the properties of Sreepadom on 13th July, 1971 there ceased to be any undivided tarwad. He asserted that the properties in suit belonged to him absolutely who before the integration of the States of Travancore and Cochin was the sovereign Ruler of Tranvancore and in that capacity held all the properties including the properties in suit, there being no distinction at that time between the properties of the Ruler and that of the Government. The properties in suit which according to respondent No. 1 were held by him as sovereign as his own were retained by him for himself absolutely when he surrendered the sovereignty of the State. Respondent No. 1 further asserted that he was competent to deal with these properties in any manner as he liked and his action in this behalf was beyond challenge. Subsequently, an additional written statement was also filed by respondent No. 1 wherein it was inter alia pleaded that the suit itself was not maintainable inasmuch as the Royal Family of Travancore even though governed by the Marumakkathayam Law as modified by custom and usage was not governed by any Statute and no member could ask for a compulsory partition of the properties of a family governed by Marumakkathayam Law. Another written statement was filed by defendant No. 3 who was the mother of respondent No. 1 wherein pleas identical to those raised by respondent No. 1 were taken. Defendant No. 12 also filed a written statement wherein inter alia she claimed absolute right over item No. 10 of Schedule A to the plaint on the basis of a grant by His Highness the Late Sreemoolam Thirunal who was at the time of the grant the Ruler of the erstwhile Travancore State. Some of the defendants who were the descendants of defendant No. 12 also filed written statements supporting the claim of the appellant except with regard to item No. 10 aforesaid which even according to them belonged absolutely to defendant No. 12. A written statement was filed also by defendants 32, 33 and 34 supporting the case of the appellant with the exception that defendant No. 32 took a further plea that she having married on 14th May, 1952 under the Special Marriage Act, 1872 became divided in status from the rest of the members of the tarwad and was consequently entitled to a l/6th share in all the property of the tarwad as at the time of her marriage there were only six members in that tarwad. The guardian of defendants 6, 7 and 10 who were minors also filed a written statement supporting the case of respondent No. 1. The State of Kerala which had been impleaded in the suit as defendant No. 35, in its written statement supported the order passed by the Kerala Land Board in the ceiling proceedings.\n3. The trial court framed necessary issues arising out of the pleadings of the parties and after giving them an opportunity of producing evidence both oral and documentary in support of their respective pleas dismissed the suit. It specifically held that the appellant and defendants 1 to 34 did not belong to an undivided marumakkathayam tarwad and that respondent No. 1 was not karnavan of any such tarwad nor were the properties in suit tarwad properties as claimed by the appellent. It also repelled the claim of defendant No. 12 that item 10 of Schedule A to the plaint was her absolute property.\n4. Aggrieved by the decree of the trial court the appellant preferred A.S. No. 210 of 1979 in the High Court whereas two cross-objections were filed, one by defendant No. 12 and the other by defendant Nos. 32 to 34. The appeal as well as the cross objections were dismissed by the High Court. Against this decree of the High Court the appellant has preferred Civil Appeal No. 534 of 1983 whereas defendant Nos. 32 to 34 have preferred Civil Appeal No. 535 of 1983. Yet another Civil Appeal being Civil Appeal No. 536 of 1983 was preferred by defendant No. 12. Since, however, defendant No. 12 died during the pendency of that Civil Appeal and no consequential steps were taken, the said appeal by order dated 16th August, 1991 passed by this Court was abated.\n5. Since it has not been seriously challenged before us that respondent No. 1 was a sovereign ruler of Travancore till 1st July, 1949 we find it unnecessary to dwell upon the question as to how sovereignty came to be vested in the rulers of Travancore. As was agreed by the parties before the High Court as also before us the crucial question for determination is about the title of the appellant over the properties in suit In other words, in the context of the pleadings of the parties the question which falls for consideration is whether the family of the appellant and defendants 1 to 34 was an undivided Marumakkathayam tarwad known as Valiakottaram governed by Marumakkathyam Law as modified by custom and usage in respect of succession, inheritance and some other matters and the properties in suit belonged to this Tarwad and respondent No. 1 had been managing the same as its Karnavan as alleged by the appellant or whether these properties were held by respondent No. 1, as asserted by him, as his personal properties carved out by him as such in his capacity as the sovereign ruler of Travancore and were retained by him as his personal properties even after he surrendered his sovereignty as indicated in the inventory furnished to the Government of India in pursuance of the convenant dated 27th May, 1949 (Ex.A2) and accepted by the Government of India vide Ex.A3.\n6. Before adverting to this question, we find it appropriate at this stage to deal with a legal plea raised by learned Counsel for the appellant about the nature and extent of authority of respondent No. 1 over the properties in suit in his capacity as the sovereign ruler of Travancore. According to learned Counsel for the appellant since the properties in suit belonged to a Tarwad and respondent No. 1 was managing them as Karnavan, as asserted by the appellant, the mere fact that he was also the sovereign ruler of Travancore was of little significance. He also urged that since respondent No. 1 was not only a Karnavan of a Tarwad but also the sovereign ruler of Travancore, the properties in suit were made impartible in order to maintain his status but after he ceased to be ruler of Travancore, these properties even though were impartible earlier became partible. Reliance was placed in this behalf on certain statutory provisions including the\nHindu Succession Act\nto which reference shall be made later. He also placed reliance on certain decisions dealing with the nature and legal incidents of an impartible estate. We propose to consider these decisions first to clear the legal ground based thereon.\n7. The first decision to which reference was made by learned Counsel for the appellant is the Privy Council decision in the case of\nBaijnath Prasad Singh and Ors. v. Tej Bali Singh\nAIR 1921 Privy Council, page 62. In this case it was reiterated that when a custom is found to exist it supersedes the general law which however still regulates all beyond the custom. It was also held that the Zamindari which was in dispute\nin that case\nbeing the ancestral property of a joint family though impartible the successor fell to be designated according to ordinary rule of Mitakshra law and that the respondent\nin that case\nbeing the person who in a joint family would, being the eldest of the senior branch, be the head of the family was the person designated in this impartible raj to occupy the Gaddi. In so far as the proposition that when a custom is found, to exist it supersedes the general law which, however, still regulates all beyond the custom is concerned no exception can be taken to it. In regard to the other proposition it may be pointed out that the dispute\nin that case\nwas about the succession to the Zamindari of Agori Barhar as is apparent from the very first sentence of the judgment even though the ancestors of the parties were referred to as Rajahs. It was apparently not a case of a sovereign ruler. The other cases on which reliance was placed in this behalf are these:\n8.\nIn\nShiba Prasad Singh v. Rani Prayag Kumari Debi and Ors.\nit was held:\nImpartibility is essentially a creature of custom. In the case of ordinary joint family property, the members of the family have : (1) the right of partition: (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head of the family except for necessity, (3) the right of maintenance; and (4) the right of survivorship. The first of these rights cannot exist in the case of an impartible estate, though ancestral, from the very nature of the estate. The second is incompatible with the custom of impartibility as\nlaid down in\nTo this extent the general law of the Mitakshara has been superseded by custom, and the impartible estate, though ancestral, is clothed with the incidents of self acquired and separate property. But the right of survivorship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility.\nThis right therefore still remains, and this is what was held in\nBaijnath\n's case A.I.R. 1921 P.C. 62. To this extent the estate still retains its character of joint family property, and its devolution is governed by the general Mitakshara law applicable to such property. Though the other rights which a co-parcener acquires by birth in joint family property no longer exsit, the birthright of the senior member to take by survivorship still remains. No. is this right a mere spes succession is similar to that of a reversioner succeeding on the death of a Hindu widow to her husband's estate. It is a right which is capable of being renounced and surrendered. Such being their Lordships' view, it follows that in order to establish that a family governed by the Mitakshara in which there is an ancestral impartible estate has ceased to be joint, it is necessary to prove an intention, express or implied, on the part of the junior members of the family to renounce their right of succession to the estate. It is not sufficient to show a separation merely in food and worship. Admittedly there is no evidence in this case of any such intention. The plaintiffs therefore have failed to prove separation, and the defendant is entitled to succeed to the impartible estate. Being entitled to the estate, he is also entitled to the improvements on the estate, being the immovable properties specified in items 9 to of Schedule Kha. These improvements, in fact, form part of the impartible estate.\n9. The question\nin that case\nrelated to the right of succession to an estate and other properties left by Raja Durga Prasad. This case too does not appear to be a case of a sovereign ruler as is apparent from the recital of facts inter alia to the effect that On 27th August, 1915 Raja Durga Prasad made a will whereby he purported to dispose of some of the properties in dispute and that the will was governed by the\nHindu Wills Act, 1870\nand several sections of the Indian Succession Act, 1865, were thereby made applicable to wills governed by that Act. Had it been a case of a sovereign ruler neither of these Acts would have been applicable to him.\n10. In Commissioner of Income-tax, Punjab, North-West Frontier and Delhi Provinces, Lahore v. Dewan Bahadur Dewan Krishna Kishore, Rais, Lahore AIR 1941 P.C. page 120, it was held that holder of an impartible estate receiving income from house property was not owner of the property and such income, therefore, was not assessable under\nSection 9\nof the Income Tax Act, 1922 and further that income from impartible estate of holder of such estate was income of individual and not income of undivided family of himself and his sons for purposes of the said\nIncome-tax Act\n. This again was apparently not a case of a sovereign ruler inasmuch as such ruler could not have been governed by the\nIncome-tax Act, 1922\n.\n11.\nIn\nMirza Raj Shri Pushavathi Viziaram Gajapathi Raj Manne Sultan Bahadur and Ors. v. Shri Pushavathi Viswesar Gajapthi Raj and Ors.\nit was held that i an ancestral estate to which the holder has succeeded by the custom of primogeniture is part of the joint estate of the undivided Hindu family. Though the other rights enjoyed by member of a joint Hindu family are inconsistent in the case of an impartible estate the right of survivorship still exists. Unless the power is excluded by statute or custom, the holder of customary impartible estate, by a declaration of his intention, can incorporate with the estate his self-acquired immovable property and thereupon the said property accrues to the estate and is impressed with all its incidents including a custom of descent by primogeniture. In all such cases the crucial test is one of intention. A holder of an impartible estate can alienate the estate by gift inter vivos, or even by a will, though the family is undivided; the only limitation on this power could be by a family custom to the contrary or the conditions of the tenure which have the same effect.\n12. In Nagesh Bisto Desai etc. etc. v. Khando Tirmal Desai etc. etc  it was held:\nIt is trite proposition that property though impartible may be the ancestral property of the joint Hindu family. The impartibility of property does not per se destroy its nature as joint family property or render it the separate property of the last holder, so as to destroy the right of survivorship; hence the estate retains its character of joint family property and devolves by the general law upon that person who being in fact and in law joint in respect of the estate is also the senior member in the senior line.\nIt was further held that since the decision of the Privy Council in\nShiba Prasad Singh\n's case (supra), it is well settled that the fact that an estate is impartible does not make it the separate and exclusive property of the holder: where the property is ancestral and the holder has succeeded to it, it will be part of the joint estate of the undivided family.\n13. The decision in this case has been reaffirmed in\nKalgonda Balgonda Patil v. Balgonda Kalgonda Patil and Ors\n. 1989(Supp.) 1SCC page 246.\n14.\nIn\nAnant Kibe and Ors. v. Purushottam Rao and Ors\n. 1984(Supp.) SCC 175, it was held that the junior members of the joint family in the case of ancient impartible joint family estate take no right in the property by birth and, therefore, have no right of partition having regard to the very nature of the estate that is impartible. The only incidence for joint property which still attaches to the joint family property is the right of survivorship which, of course, is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibiliy. Referring to the facts of the case it was pointed out in paragraph 8 of the Report that there was ample evidence on record to show that the inam lands although impartible were always treated by members of the family as part of the joint family properties and the succession to the inam was by the rule of survivorship as modified by the rule of lineal primogeniture. It was also clear that the junior members were in joint enjoyment of the inam lands and the evidence showed that the properties acquired by the inamdar for the time being from out of the income of the inam such as the two houses at Indore, and other properties were always dealt with as part of the joint family property.\n15. In Thakore Shri Vinayasinhji (Dead) by Lrs. v. Kumar Shri Natwarsinhji and Ors. 1988 (Supp) SCC 133, the decision of the Privy Council in the case of\nShiba Prasad Singh\n(supra) was referred to with approval.\n16.\nIn\nBhaiya Ramanuj Pratap Deo v. Lalu Maheshanuj Pratap Deo and Ors.\nalso the decision of the Privy Council in the case of\nShiba Prasad Singh\n(supra) was referred to with approval. It was further held in this case relying on Chinnathayi.\nalias\nVeeralakshmi v. Kulasekara Pandiya Naicker and Anr.\n(1952) SCR 251,that to establish that an impartible estate has ceased to be joint family property for purposes of succession it is necessary to prove an intention, express or implied, on the part of the junior members of the family to give up their chance of succeeding to the estate.\n17. So far as these decisions are concerned, apart from the fact that in the instant case the respondent No. 1 was holding the properties in dispute as a sovereign rule and his right over these properties will have to be considered in this background, what has been held in the aforesaid cases may be of some assistance if it is found as a fact that the family of the appellant and defendants 1 to 34 was an undivided Marumakkathayam tarwad known as Valiakottaram governed by Marumakkathayam Law as modified by custom and usage in respect of succession, inheritance and some other matters and the properties in suit belonged to this Tarwad and respondent No. 1 had been managing the same as its Karnavan as alleged by the appellant. On the other hand, if it is found that these properties were personal properties of respondent No. 1 in the manner alleged by him, these decisions will be of no assistance. The fate of this appeal really, therefore, depends on the decision of the question\nreferred to above\nwith regard to the nature of the property.\n18. The decision on the said question one way or the other would have bearing on the other submission made by learned Counsel for the appellant that the impartible nature of the property in suit came to an end on the commencement of the\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nand at all events on the commencement of the\nKerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975\n. As regards the\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nreliance was placed on\nSection 4\nand Sub-section (1) of\nSection 7\n. It was urged that Respondent No. 1 having since died, the properties in suit in view of Sub-section (1) of\nSection 7\nand the overriding effect of\nSection 4\n\"'shall devolve by testamentary succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not according to the Marumakkathayam or Nambudri Law\" as contemplated by Sub-section (1) of\nSection 7\nread with the Explanation thereto which reads as hereunder:\n7. Devolution of interest in the property of a tarwad, tavazhi, kutumba, kavaru or illom:-\n(1) When a Hindu to whom the marumakkattayam or nambudri law would have applied if this Act had not been passed dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his or her death an interest in the property of a tarwad, tavazhi or illom, as the case may be, his or her interest in the intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not according to the marumakkattayam or nambudri law.\nExplanation:- For the purposes of this sub-section, the interest of a Hindu in the property of a tarwad, tavazhi or illom shall be deemed to be the share in the property of the tarwad, tavazhi or illom, as the case may be, that would have fallen to him or her if a partition of that property per capita had been made immediately before his or her death among all the members of the tarwad, tavazhi or illom, as the case may be, then living, whether he or she was entitled to claim such partition or not under the marumakkattayam or nambudri law applicable to him or her, and such share shall be deemed to have been allotted to him or her absolutely.\n(2)...\n(3) ...\n19. In so far as the\nKerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975\nis concerned reliance has been placed on\nSection 4\nwhich contemplates replacement of joint tenancy by tenancy in common. Sub-section (1) applies to members of an undivided Hindu family governed by Mitakshara Law holding common coparcenary property on the day the said Act came into force. Sub-section (2) on the other hand applies to members of a joint Hindu family, other than undivided Hindu family referred to in Sub-section (1). Since reliance has been placed on this sub-section it is reproduced hereunder:\n4. Joint tenancy to be replaced by tenancy in common:\n(1) ...\n(2) All members of a joint Hindu family, other than an undivided Hindu family referred to in Sub-section (1), holding any joint family property on the day this Act comes into force, shall, with effect from that day be deemed to hold it as tenants-in-common, as if a partition of such property per capita had taken place among all the members of the family living on the day aforesaid, whether such members were entitled to claim such partition or not under the law applicable to them, and as if each one of the members is holding his or her share separately as full owner thereof.\n20. A perusal of the provisions in the two Acts\nreferred to above\nmakes it clear that Sub-section (1) of\nSection 7\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 would apply only if the properties in suit were \"property of a tarwad, tavazhi or illom, as the case may be,\" and Respondent No. 1 had, at the time of his death,' 'interest'' therein. Sub-section (2) of\nSection 4\nof the Kerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975 on the other hand would apply to the members of the joint Hindu family concerned \"holding any joint family property on the day this Act comes into force\". On a plain reading of the sub-sections\nreferred to above\nit is apparent that neither of them would apply if the properties in suit did not fall under the categories referred to therein but were at the relevant time the personal properties of Respondent No. 1. It is for this reason that the applicability of these two Acts would depend as indicated earlier on the finding of the crucial question in regard to the nature of the properties in suit.\n21. Before adverting to the question\nreferred to above\nwe consider it appropriate to deal with another submission made by learned Counsel for the appellant that the properties in suit constituted \"Sthanam\" and Respondent No. 1 was a Sthani thereof and consequently the provisions of Sub-section (3) of\nSection 7\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 would be applicable to the properties in suit. This plea was raised before the High Court also and was repelled inter alia by holding:\nBefore we look into the law on this subject we have to consider whether there is any foundation for such a case in the pleadings of the parties. We found in the pleadings no reference to the office of the Ruler being that of a Stani. Stanom is a peculiar institution familiar in the northern part of the Kerala State, namely, Malabar and is not a well-known institution in Travancore. The institution of Stanom has peculiar incidents. Merely because a person is an eldest member of the family he does not become a Stani. We are mentioning this only to emphasise our point that if it is a case based upon stanom that the court is now called upon to consider that must necessarily have been a matter of pleadings. There is no such pleading in the case.\n22. While referring to the observations of Lord Dunedin in Siddik Mahomed Shah v. Mt. Saran  that 'no amount of evidence can be looked into upon a plea which was never put forward\", it was held by this Court in\nNagubai Ammal and Ors. v. B. Shama Rao and Ors.\n:\nThe true scope of this rule is that evidence let in on issues on which the parties actually went to trial should not be made the foundation for decision of another and different issue, which was not present to the minds of the parties and on which they had no opportunity of adducing evidence. But that rule has no application to a case where parties go to trial with knowledge that a particular question is in issue, though no specific issue has been framed thereon, and adduce evidence relating thereto.\n23. The same view was reiterated in\nMoran Mar Basselios Catholicos v. Thukalan Paulo Avira and Ors.\nAIR 1959 SC Page 31.\n24. Nothing on the record has been brought to our notice by learned Counsel for the appellant that Respondent No. 1 went to trial with knowledge that the question of there being a Sthanam and he being a Sthani thereof was in issue and that any evidence on the basis of such knowledge was produced on his behalf. Consequently the use of the word \"Sthanam\" in Exhibits A-3 and B-9 on which reliance was sought to be placed before us by learned Counsel for the appellant cannot be made the foundation for decision of the question about the existence of a Sthanam and Respondent No. 1 being a Sthani thereof.\n25. It was, however, urged by learned Counsel for the appellant that whether or not there was a Sthanam is a pure question of law and consequently even in the absence of any pleading or issue on the point the question can still be raised. We find it difficult to agree with this submission. The Treatise on Malabar & Aliyasanthana Law (1922 Edition) by P.R. Sundara Aiyar which is a standard book on the subject has been relied on even by learned Counsel for the appellant with regard to the origin and nature of Sthanam. In the said book itself, however, it is specifically stated in paragraph 154 at page 256:-\nThe question whether there is a stanom in any particular case must be decided upon the evidence of usage adduced, and the onus is of course upon those who assert that any particular property belongs to an individual and not to the family to which the individual belongs. It is not sufficient to make a stanom that properties are temporarily allotted to a person filling a particular position; the evidence must be sufficient to prove a long continued usage recognising the property in question as belonging to the person filling a particular position without any interest in the members of the family to which the person holding the position belongs and without any power in them to terminate the arrangement. Is it open to a family to constitute a fresh stanom? The answer would probably be the same as to the question whether it is open to the members of a family governed by the Mitakshara Law to constitute certain property impartible and vest it in a single individual with succession according to the rule of primogeniture. In both cases the answer must be in the negative. Impartible estates and sthanams are recognisable only on the ground of custom. They are held not according to the rules of the common law of the land but in a manner different from such rules but sanctioned by usage.\n26. In this view of the matter in the absence of any pleading or issue on the point the appellant cannot be permitted to raise this question on the footing that it was a pure question of law. There is yet another ground which disentitles the appellant from raising this plea. In his grounds of appeal before the High Court the appellant has taken a specific ground being ground No. 29 to the following effect:\nThe court below should have found that Ex.A3 has hot created a sthanam in respect of the plaint schedule properties and the court below also failed to note that the 1st defendant has no case that he is a sthani and that the plaint A schedule properties are sthanam properties. The decision in 1960 K.L.T.S.C. 31 quoted by the court below should have been found not applicable to the facts of the case.\n27. This being his categorical stand before the High Court, he cannot now be permitted to take a somersault. On this view, we find it unnecessary to deal with certain cases relied on by learned Counsel for the appellant to indicate the nature and incidence of the properties of a Sthanam and the rights of a Sthani therein.\n28. At this stage another plea raised by learned Counsel for the appellant with regard to the burden of proof may also be disposed of. Relying on the decision of the Privy Council in\nMartand Rao v. Malhar Rao\nAIR 1923 Privy Council Page 10 it was urged that when there is a dispute with respect to an estate being impartible or otherwise, the onus lies on the party who alleges the existence of a custom different from the ordinary law of inheritance according to which custom the estate is to be held by a single member and, as such, was not liable to partition. For Respondent No. 1 on the other hand it has been urged that it not having been disputed that, at any rate till Respondent No. 1 was the sovereign Ruler of Travancore, the properties in suit were impartible and descendible to a single person the burden to prove that those properties were joint family properties and thus partible was on the appellant, he being the plaintiff so as to be able to obtain a decree in his favour.\nSuffice it to say, so far as the question of burden of proof is concerned, that it has been held in\nMoran Mar Basselios Catholicos\n(supra) that the question of burden of proof at the end of the case when both parties have adduced evidence is not of very great importance and the Court has to come to a decision on the consideration of all materials\".\nThis view has been reiterated in\nNarayan Bhagwantarao Gosavi Balajiwale v. Gopal Vinayak Gosavi and Ors.\nand several other subsequent decisions and is by now settled law.\n29. Now we may consider the legal effect of respondent No. 1 being a sovereign ruler of Travancore till he surrendered the sovereignty as indicated earlier.\nIn\nAmeer-un-Nissa Begum and Ors. v. Mahboob Begum and Ors.\ndealing with the efficacy of certain 'Firmans' issued by the Nizam of Hyderabad who was a sovereign ruler, it was, with regard to the powers of the Nizam, held:-\nIt cannot be disputed that prior to the integration of Hyderabad State with the Indian Union and the coming into force of the Indian Constitution, Nizam of Hyderabad enjoyed uncontrolled sovereign powers. He was the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive, and there was no constitutional limitation upon his authority to act in any of these capacities. The 'Firmans' were expressions of the sovereign will of the Nizam and they were binding in the same way as any other law; - nay, they would override all other laws which were in conflict with them. So long as a particular 'Firman' held the field, that alone would govern or regulate the rights of the parties concerned, though it could be annulled or modified by a later 'Firman' at any time that the Nizam willed...\nThe Nizam was not only the supreme legislature, he was the fountain of justice as well. When he constituted a new Court, he could, according to ordinary notions, be deemed to have exercised his legislative authority. When again he affirmed or reversed a judicial decision, that may appropriately be described as a judicial act. A rigid line of demarcation, however, between the one and the other would from the very nature of things be not justified or even possible.\n30. The same view was reiterated in\nDirector of Endowments, Government of Hyderabad and Ors. v. Akram Ali\nwherein it was held:\nNow the Nizam was an absolute sovereign regarding all domestic matters at that time and his word was law. It does not matter whether this be called legislation or an executive act or a judicial determination because there is in fact no clear cut dividing line between the various functions of an absolute ruler whose will is law. Whatever he proclaimed through his Firmans had the combined effect of law and the decree of a Court: see the judgment of this Court in -\n'Ameerunnissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum' (A\n). Therefore, the effect of this Firman was to deprive the respondent and all other claimants of all rights to possession \"pending enquiry of the case\". Exactly what this means is not clear but, taken in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances and with the decision of the Director of the Ecclesiastical Department to which we have referred, it is fair to assume that it means, pending the enquiry by the Civil Courts about which the Director had twice spoken, that is to say, if there was a right to possession it was held in abeyance till established by the Civil Courts.\nNow, as we have said, the Nizam was at that time an absolute ruler and could do what he pleased. His will, as expressed in his Firman, was the law of the land. Therefore, even if it be assumed that the respondent was in possession, whatever they may have been, were taken away and held in abeyance till he could establish them in the Civil Courts. The question now arises whether this enured after the Constitution and whether the respondent's right to possession, assuming he had any, revived when the Constitution came into being. We are clear that the Constitution effected no change.\nIt was conceded that the Nizam had power to confiscate the property and to take it away from the respondent 'in toto' and it was conceded that if he had done so the rights so destroyed would not have revived because the Constitution only guarantees to a citizen such rights as he had at the date it came into force; it does not alter them or add to them: all it guarantees is that he shall not be deprived of such rights as he has except in such ways as the Constitution allows. But if the Nizam could take away every vestige of right by a Firman he could equally take away a part of them and at the date of the passing of the Constitution the respondent would only have the balance of the rights left to him and not the whole, for what applies to the whole applies equally to the part.\nTherefore, even if we accept all the respondent's facts, the position would still be that at the date the Constitution came into force he had no right to immediate possession; the utmost he had was a right to be restored to possession if and when he established his rights in a Court of law.\n31.\nIn\nMadhaorao Phalke v. The State of Madhya Bharat\nwhile dealing with the powers of Sir Madhavrao, who was a sovereign ruler of the State of Gwalior, it was held:-\nIt would thus be seen that though Sir Madhavrao was gradually taking steps to associate the public with the government of the State and with that object he was establishing institutions consistent with the democratic form of rule, he had maintained all his powers as a sovereign with himself and had not delegated any of his powers in favour of any of the said bodies. In other words, despite the creation of these bodies the Maharaja continued to be an absolute monarch in whom were vested the supreme power of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.\nIn dealing with the question as to whether the orders issued by such an absolute monarch amount to a law or regulation having the force of law, or whether they constitute merely administrative orders, it is important to bear in mind that the distinction between executive orders and legislative commands is likely to be merely academic where the Ruler is the source of all power. There was no constitutional limitation upon the authority of the Ruler to act in any capacity he liked; he would be the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive, and all his orders, however issued, would have the force of law and would govern and regulate the affairs of the State including the rights of its citizens.\nIn\nAmeer-un-Nissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum\n(), this Court had to deal with the effect of a Firman issued by the Nizam, and it observed that so long as the particular Firman issued by the Nizam held the field that alone would govern and regulate the rights of the parties concerned though it would be annulled or modified by a later Firman at any time that the Nizam willed. what was held about the Firman issued by the Nizam would be equally true about all effective orders issued by the Ruler of Gwalior.\n32. While dealing with a Firman issued by the Maharana of Udaipur who too was a sovereign ruler, it was held in\nTilkoyat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors.\nfollows:\nIn appreciating the effect of this firman, it is first necessary to decide whether the Firman is a law or not. It is matter of common knowledge that at the relevant time the Maharana of Udaipur was an absolute monarch in whom vested all the legislative, judicial and executive powers of the State. In the case of an absolute Ruler like the Maharana of Udaipur, it is difficult to make any distinction between an executive order issued by him or a legislative command issued by him. Any order issued by such a Ruler has the force of law and did govern the rights of the parties affected thereby.\n33. In Civil Appeal No. 242 of 1955 Mangal Singh and Ors. v. The Legal Remembrancer, Punjab and Ors. decided by this Court on 23rd February, 1960 a plea questioning the validity of certain orders passed by the Maharaja of Patiala with regard to a Gurdwara had been raised. An issue about the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to adjudicate upon the said plea was framed While dealing with the plea a Constitution Bench after referring to certain earlier decisions of this Court held:\nIt cannot be, and has not been, disputed that the position of the Maharaja of Patiala before the coming into force of the Constitution was the same as that, for example, of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, or the Maharao of Kotah, or the Nizam of Hyderabad. He would therefore, be in view of the cases cited above, an absolute sovereign so far as the internal administration of the State is concerned. Under the circumstances, the order Ex. DA of April 2, 1945, be it called judicial or executive, which expressed his will with respect to this Gurdwara and the land in dispute and the management of the Gurdwara and the land belonging to it would be binding on all authorities within his State, and it would not be open to any Court to question that will. In this view of the matter the High Court was in our opinion right in holding that the jurisdiction of the civil court was barred as the sovereign had expressed his will that the land in dispute belonged to the Gurdwara and ; should be managed by a committee which would be in-charge of the Gurdwara.\n34. In another decision of this Court in Civil No. 226 of 1965 Mahant Hardial Singh v. Ajmer Singh and Ors. decided on November 20, 1968 with regard to the powers of Maharaja of Patiala this Court held:\nWe think that this appeal must fail on the short ground that the sale in favour of Seth . Banarsi Das cannot be impugned in view of the orders made by His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala. It must be remembered that at the time the transaction took place, Patiala was a native State and the Maharaja enjoyed uncontrolled sovereign powers. At that time he was the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive. There was no constitutional limitation on his authority to act in any of the capacities. His . order were expressions of the sovereign Will and they were binding in the same way as any other law, nay, they would override all other laws which were in conflict with them. So long as his order held the field that alone would govern or regulate the rights of the parties concerned though it could have been annulled or modified by him at any time he willed.\n35.\nIn\nD.S. Meramwala Bhayala v. Ba Shri Amarba Jethsurbhai\n(1968) ILR 9 Gujarat Page 966 it was held:\nThere is, therefore, no doubt that the Khari-Bagasara Estate was a sovereign Estate and the Chief of the Khari-Bagasara Estate for the time being was a sovereign Ruler within his own territories subject to the paramountcy of the British Crown prior to 15th August, 1947 and completely independent after that date.\nIf the Khari-Bagasara Estate was a sovereign Estate, it is difficult to see how the ordinary incidents of ancestral coparcenary property could be applied to that Estate. The characteristic feature of the ancestral coparcenary property is that members of the family acquire an interest in the property by birth or adoption and by virtue of such interest they can claim four rights: (1) the right of partition; (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head of the family except for necessity; (3) the right of maintenance; and (4) the right of survivorship. It is obvious from the nature of a sovereign Estate that there can be no interest by birth or adoption in such Estate and these rights which are the necessary consequence of community of interest cannot exist. The Chief of a sovereign Estate would hold the Estate by virtue of his sovereign power and not by virtue of municipal law. He would not be subject to municipal law; he would in fact be the fountain head of municipal law. The municipal law cannot determine or control the scope and extent of his interest in the estate or impose any limitations on his powers in relation to the Estate, as a sovereign ruler he would be the full and complete owner of the Estate entitled to do what he likes with the Estate. During his lifetime no one else can claim an interest in the Estate. Such an interest would be inconsistent with his sovereignty. To grant that the sons acquire an interest by birth or adoption in the Estate which is a consequence arising under the municipal law would be to make the Chief who is the sovereign Ruler of the Estate subject to the municipal law. Besides, if the sons acquire an interest in the Estate by birth or adoption, they would be entitled to claim the rights enumerated above but these rights cannot exist in sovereign Estate. None of these rights can be enforced against the Chief by a remedy in the municipal Courts, the Chief being the sovereign Ruler, there can be no legal sanction for enforcement of these rights. The remedy for enforcement of these rights would not be a remedy at law but resort would have to be taken to force for the Chief as the sovereign Ruler would not be subject to municipal law and his actions would not be controlled by the municipal Courts. Now it is impossible to conceive of a legal right which has no legal remedy. If a claim is not legally enforceable, it would not constitute a legal right and, therefore, by the very nature of a sovereign Estate, the sons cannot have these rights and if these rights cannot exist in the sons, it must follow as a necessary corollary that the sons do not acquire an interest in the Estate by birth or adoption...\n... Now it was not disputed on behalf of Meramvala that if prior to merger the Estate did not partake of the character of ancestral coparcenary property, the properties left with Bhayawala under the merger agreement would not be ancestral coparcenary properties: if Meramvala did not have any interest in the Estate prior to merger, he would have no interest in the properties which remained with Bhayavala under the merger agreement. It was not the case of Meramvala-and it could not be the case since the merger agreement would be an act of State-that as a result of the merger agreement any interest was acquired by him in the properties held by Bhayavala. Bhayavala was, therefore, the full owner of the properties held by him and was competent to dispose of the same by will...\n...The argument of Mr. I.M. Nanavati however was that the effect of applicability of the rule of primogeniture by the paramount power was that the rights of coparceners under the ordinary Hindu law were eclipsed: these rights were not destroyed but they remained dormant and on the lapse of paramountcy, the shadow of the eclipse being removed, the rights sprang into full force and effect. This argument is wholly unsustainable on principle.\n36. It has been brought to our notice by learned Counsel for Respondent No. 1 that Civil Appeal Nos. 1358-1359 of 1969 were filed in this Court against the aforesaid judgment of the Gujarat High Court which were initially dismissed on 29th March, 1974 with certain observations. Subsequently, two Review Petitions bearing Nos. 45-46 of 1974 were filed which were disposed of on 17th March, 1976 by the following order:\nThe order dated 29-3-1974 in C.A. No. 1358-59/69 is recalled and the following order is passed by consent of parties:\nBoth the C.As. 1358-59/69 had abated when they were heard. They are therefore dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n37. Against a judgment of the then Supreme Court of Bombay an appeal was taken up before the Privy Council and the judgment of the Privy Council was reported in Elphinstone v. Bedreechund 12 English Reports Page 340. In the foot note of that judgment at page 345 while dealing with the question as to whether there was any distinction between the public and private property of Peishwa Bajee Row, the following passage occurs: The Privy Council reversed the judgment of the Court at Bombay. In the course of the argument Lord Tenterden asked, \"What is the distinction between the public and private property of an absolute sovereign? You mean by public property, generally speaking, the property of the State, but in the property of an absolute sovereign, who may dispose of every thing at any time, and in any way he pleases, is there any distinction?\" and in delivering the judgment of their Lordships he also observed, \"another point made, which applies itself only to a part of the information, is, that the property was not proved to have been the public property of the Peishwa. Upon that point I have already intimated my opinion, and I have the concurrence of the other Lords of the Council with me in it, that when you are speaking of the property of an absolute sovereign there is no pretence for drawing a distinction, the whole of it belongs to him as sovereign, and he may dispose of it for his public or private purposes in whatever manner he may think proper.\n38. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Volume 8, under the caption \"The Title to the Crown\" paragraphs 851, 897 and 1076 have, in our opinion, a bearing on the question raised in the instant case with regard to the powers of a sovereign. In paragraph 851 it has been pointed out that on the death of the reigning sovereign the crown vests immediately in the person who is entitled to succeed, it being a maxim of the common law that the King never dies. The new sovereign is, therefore, entitled to exercise full prerogative rights without further ceremony. In paragraph 897 on the other hand it has been pointed out that the sovereign is regarded legally as immortal, the maxim of law being that \"the King never dies\". Paragraph 1076 inter alia provides:\nPriority of Crown rights. Where the Crown's right and that of a subject meet at one and the same time, that of the Crown is in general preferred, the rule being \"detur digniori\". Thus, the Crown cannot have a joint property with any person in one entire chattel, or one which is not capable of division, and where the title of the Crown and a subject concur, the Crown takes the whole. So if an indivisible chattel or a debt are assigned to the Crown and a subject, or where two persons have a joint property in such a chattel or debt and one person assigns his share to the Crown, or where a bond is made to the Crown and a subject, the Crown takes the whole, for it cannot be a partner with a subject; nor can the Crown become a joint owner of a chattel real by grant or contract, but takes the whole.\n39. This being the law with regard to the powers of a sovereign and the legal status of the properties held by him there can be no manner of doubt that till the sovereignty of the Maharaja of Travancore had ceased he was entitled to treat and use the properties under his sovereignty in any manner he liked and his Will in this regard was supreme. On the principle that a sovereign never dies and succession to the next ruler takes place without there being a hiatus there could be no change in the legal status of the properties held by one ruler and his successor. As seen above, one incidence of property held by a sovereign was that there was really no distinction between the public or State properties on the one hand and private properties of the sovereign on the other. The other incidence was that no one could be a co-owner with the sovereign in the properties held by him. As observed by Lord Tenterden referred to earlier when you are speaking of the property of an absolute sovereign there is no pretence of drawing a distinction, the whole of it belongs to him as sovereign and he may dispose of it for his public or private purposes in whatever manner he may think proper.\n40. That respondent No. 1 was a sovereign and the properties in dispute as held by the sovereign rulers from time to time were impartible has not been disputed by the learned Counsel for the appellant before us. What has been urged by him, however, is that the properties in dispute belonged to a tarwad and were as such joint Hindu family properties and the attribute of impartibility applied to them because by custom only the eldest member of the family could be the ruler and to maintain his dignity and status it was necessary to make these properties impartible.\n41. In this connection it has to be kept in mind that the mode of succession of a sovereign ruler and the powers of such a ruler are two different concepts. Mode of succession regulates the process whereby one sovereign ruler is succeeded by the other. It may inter alia be governed by the rule of general primog(sic)iture or lineal primogeniture or any other established rule governing succession. This process ends with one sovereign succeeding another. Thereafter what powers, privileges and prerogatives are to be exercised by the sovereign is a question which is not relatable to the process of succession but relates to the legal incidents of sovereignty.\n42. If some one asserts that to a particular property held by a sovereign the legal incidents of sovereignty do not apply, it will have to be pleaded and established by him that the said property was held by the sovereign not as a sovereign but in some other capacity. In the instant case apart from asserting that the properties in suit belonged to a joint family and Respondent No. 1 even though a sovereign ruler, held them as the head of the family to which the property belonged, the appellant has neither specifically pleaded nor produced any convincing evidence in support of such an assertion. It has been urged on behalf of the appellant that only the eldest male off-spring of the Attingal Ranis could, by custom, be the ruler and all the heirs of the Ranis who constituted joint Hindu family would be entitled to a share in the properties of the Ranis and the properties in suit were held by Respondent No. 1 as head of the tarwad even though impartible in his hands. This plea has been repelled by the trial court as well as by the High Court and nothing convincing has been brought to our notice on the basis of which the presumption canvassed on behalf of the appellant could be drawn and the findings of the courts below reversed. We are dealing with an appeal and as has been pointed out by this Court in\nThakur Sukhpal Singh v. Thakur Kalyan Singh\nit is the duty of the appellant to show that the judgment under appeal is erroneous.\n43. The following extract from pages 190 to 192 of Kerala District Gazetteers, Trivandrum by A. Sreedhara Menon will give a glimpse about the nature of property held by the Attingal Ranis.\nEarly in his reign Marthanda Varma assumed direct control over the so-called Attingal 'Queendom'. This was not an act of annexation or conquest, but Nagam Aiya has described the event as \"the amalgamation of Travancore with Attingal\". There has been some misunderstanding among contemporary and later writers in regard to the significance of this step taken by Marthanda Varma. This is the result of a general notion that Attingal was an independent State ruled by the Ranis and that the Kings of Travancore never exercised any authority in the tract. Certain statements found in the memoirs, commentaries and State papers of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English have only served to strengthen this notion. According to Van Rheede (1677) \"the Princess of Attingal who is not alone the mother of Travancore, but the eldest of Tippaporsorewam has a large territory of her own independent of Travancore\". Hamilton even refers to a regular treaty between Marthanda Varma and the Rani by which the former strengthened the position of the King. He says that \"the Tamburetties of Attingal possessed the sovereignty of Travancore from remote antiquity, until Raja Marthanda Varma persuaded the Tamburetty to resign the sovereign authority to the Rajas, both for himself and for all succeeding Tamburetties. To perpetuate these conditions, a regular treaty was executed between the Raja and the Tamburetty, which was inscribed on a silver plate, and rectified by the most solemn imprecations, limiting the succession to the offsprings of the Attingal Tamburetties. Having concluded this arrangement Raja Marthanda Varma directed his arms against the neighbouring States\". The theory that the Ranis of Attingal exercised sovereign powers is, however, incorrect. The fact is that in political matters the Ranis of Attingal as such exercised no sovereign rights. Any grant of rights over immovable property by the Ranis of Attingal required the King's previous assent or subsequent confirmation for its validity. It may be noted that the so-called Queendom of Attingal had its origin in the 5th century Kollam Era when two princesses were adopted into the Venad family from Kolathunad and the revenues from certain estates in and around Attingal were assigned to them for their exclusive use. Since then the female members of the ruling family of Travancore had come to be known as Attingal Ranis. It was only the male children of these Tamburatties, either by birth or by adoption, who could inherit the throne. Thus Marthanda Varma and the heir-apparent Rama Varma were both sons of Attingal Tamburatties. This tended to invest the Attingal Ranis with a special dignity in the eyes of the people, native as well as foreign, and led to the notion that they had sovereign rights over Attingal. But in reality the Kingdom of Venad extended from Kanyakumari in the south as far as Kannetti in the north, and there was no kingdom or principality intervening within its limits. When Marthanda Varma decided to assume direct control over the estates of Attingal and thus deprive the Rani of some of her rights, he was not interfering in the affairs of a sovereign State. As the head of the royal family and the ruler of the State, he had every right to interfere in the affairs of a part of his kingdom, The Rani of Attingal had neither territory nor subjects, except in the sense that the people of Venad paid respects to her as a senior member of the ruling family. What she possessed was nothing more than the control over the revenues of the estates and an outward status and dignity. Whatever powers she exercised were those delegated to her by the head of the family and the sovereign of the State.\n44. The historical perspective\nreferred to above\nruns counter to the case of the appellant with regard to the rights of respondent No. 1 over the properties in suit even if it may be accepted that at some point of time they or any part of them were held by the Attingal Ranis before Marthanda Verma had assumed direct control as sovereign ruler of Travancore over the properties of Attingal Ranis. After the assumption of direct control by Marthanda Varma the properties held by the Ranis, whatsoever the extent and nature of such properties may have been earlier, became properties of the State of Travancore and the legal incidents of property held by a sovereign as\nreferred to above\napplied to them also. There was no scope of such properties continuing to be joint family properties after such assumption of direct control.\n45. The properties in suit having passed on from one sovereign to the other came to be ultimately held by Respondent No. 1 in that capacity. Neither any principle nor authority nor even any grant etc. has been brought to our notice on the basis of which it could be held that in the properties of the State held by a sovereign an interest was created or came into being in favour of the family to which the sovereign belonged.\n46. At this place reference may be made to the following finding of the High Court:\nNo attempt has been made to adduce evidence directly bearing on the question as to how each one of the plaint schedule items are acquired. There is no pleading also as to the source of acquisition. There is no evidence not only as to how they were acquired, but even as to who acquired these items. Perhaps such evidence is not available and it is not possible to get at such evidence in the case.\n47. We may here point out that such properties of the family to which the sovereign belonged as were allowed to retain their original character would of course fall in a different category. According to Respondent No. 1 there were such properties known as Sreepadam properties which fell in this category and in which the family members continued to have an interest. These Sreepadam properties according to him were only those which were partitioned in 1971 by the deed of partition executed in this behalf being Exhibit B-3 on the record of the suit. As regards the properties in suit what has been asserted on his behalf is that before he surrendered his sovereignty there was no distinction between the properties of the ruler and that of the State and that before surrendering his sovereignty he had entered into a covenant whereby he was given an option to furnish a list of such properties which he wanted to retain as personal properties and that he having furnished such a list which included the properties in suit and the same having been approved by the Government of India the properties in suit continued to be held by him as his personal properties in the capacity of being their absolute owner. We find substance in both these contentions.\n48. As regards Exhibit B-3 it would be seen that this deed of partition was executed by the then living members of the Royal Family. Even the appellant who was a minor at that time was represented by his mother. This deed starts with the assertion that the parties to it \"are members of the joint Hindu Kshatria family known as 'Sreepadom Palace' which by prerogative is the Royal House of Travancore.\" It then proceeds to describe the extent of the properties held by the Sreepadom and states:\nThe lands and other immovable properties mentioned in the Schedule attached hereto have been inherited, held and enjoyed by our family, the aforesaid Sreepadom Palace, as Sreepadom Palace Private Properties and the family continues to have exclusive, absolute and undisputed title of ownership, possession and enjoyment by the laws of inheritance, custom, proprietorship and tradition.\nThe Sreepadom Lands, enfranchised as aforesaid, as well as the private family properties, more particularly described in the Schedule hereunder, were administered by His Highness 'Sree Padmabha Dass Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma who is the senior most male member of the family.\n49. After discussing in detail the status of Attingal Ranis and the mode in which some of the properties came to be held by them the High Court in the judgment appealed against has held:\nThe Sreepadom Palace is the residence of the Attingal Ranees and naturally the Attingal Ranees and the children would constitute a Marumakkathayam Tarwad. Properties were assigned even at the time of the original adoption in 483 M.E. to the family of Attingal Ranees for the purpose of their maintenance in accordance with the style of living expected of them. It is these properties and properties which came into the family later which were subject matter of division under Ext B.3 partition deed in 1971.\n50. From the aforementioned discussion by the High Court and the tenure of the deed of partition Exhibit B-3 particularly the meticulous care with which the properties which were the subject-matter of partition were described both in the body of the deed and the Schedule appended thereto were of the opinion that all the properties belonging to the joint family in which the appellant could have a share or interest were subject-matter of and covered by this deed of partition.\n51. It is not disputed that the properties in suit do not form part of this deed of partition. No convincing reason for this significant omission has been brought to our notice. Keeping in view the fact as indicated above that meticulous care was taken to describe the properties which were being partitioned by Exhibit B-3 and the presumed knowledge ability of the persons who were parties to this deed with regard to the family properties it is difficult to believe that at the time when the deed of partition was executed the properties in dispute were not in the knowledge of the persons who were parties to the said deed. The conclusion and indeed the only conclusion which can be drawn from this omission is that at the time of the execution of the deed of partition the parties thereto were fully conscious of the fact that the properties in dispute were not joint family properties. In this context not much significance can be attached to paragraph 19 of the deed of partition on which reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the appellant. The said paragraph reads as hereunder:\nIf any property over which the Sreepadom Palace has ownership and remaining as Sreepadom Palace Private property has been omitted to be included in this partition, and the omission is detected at a subsequent date it will also be shared equally between the two branches by mutual agreement to be entered upon as and when such necessity arises.\nIn our opinion, paragraph 19\nreferred to above\nwas incorporated in the deed of partition in a routine manner it having become almost customary to include such a clause by way of abundant caution. As already indicated above and particularly keeping in view the extent and nature of the properties in dispute it is unbelievable that the parties to the deed of partition were not aware about the existence of these properties and left it to be partitioned in future as and when \"the omission is detected\".\n52. There is another circumstance which supports this contention. Some of the properties in suit were made subject-matter of declaration of ceiling area under the\nKerala Land Reforms Act, 1963\n. Section 82 of the said Act provides the extent of the land which is to constitute the ceiling area whereas Section 83 provides that with effect from such date as may be notified by the Government in the Gazette no person shall be entitled to own or to hold or to possess under a mortgage lands in the aggregate in excess of the ceiling area. For purposes of determination of ceiling area ceiling returns were to be filed under Section 85 of that Act. Sub-section .(2) of Section 85 inter alia provided that where a person owned or held land in excess of the ceiling area such person shall within a period of three months from the date notified under Section 81 file a statement before the Land Board intimating the location, extent and such other particulars as may be prescribed, of all lands (including lands exempted under Section 81) owned or held by such person and indicating the lands proposed to be surrendered. The date which was notified under Section 83 was 1st of January, 1970. It is significant to mention here that only Respondent No. 1 had filed a return and that too in his capacity as an individual. Section 85A which was inserted by Act 17 of 1972 inter alia provided in its Sub-section (1):\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter, every family consisting of more than one member, owning or holding more than twelve acres in extent of land, every adult unmarried person and every family consisting of a sole surviving member, owning or holding more than six acres in extent of lands and every other person (other than a bank) owning or holding more than twelve acres in extent of land shall, within a period of seventy-five days from the commencement of the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972, file a statement before the Land Board intimating the location, extent and such other particulars as may be prescribed, of all lands (including lands exempted under Section 81 owned or held by such family or person).\n53. The appellant or any other member of the family did not file a return as contemplated by either Sub-section (2) of Section 85 or by Section 85A. The consequence of not filing a return was that apart from the land which was found to be within the ceiling area of Respondent No. 1 who had filed the return the rest of the land was to be declared surplus and was to vest in the State Government. In our opinion, keeping in view the penal consequence of not filing a return namely being deprived of retaining land even to the extent of the ceiling area the circumstance that the appellant or any member of the family did not file a return is indicative of the fact that they did not consider these lands to belong to the joint family.\n54. At this place, in order to keep the record straight we wish to point out that subsequently an application was made by the appellant under Sub-section (9) of Section 85 of the Kerala Land Reforms which inter alia provides:\nThe Taluk Land Board may, at any lime, set aside its order under Sub-section (5) or Sub-section (7), as the case may be, and proceed afresh under that sub-section if it is satisfied that-\n(a) the extent of lands surrendered by, or assumed from, a person under Section 86 is less than the extent of lands which he was liable to surrender under the provisions of this Act, or\n(b) the lands surrendered by, or assumed from, a person are not lawfully owned or held by him; or\n(c) in a case where a person is, according to such order, not liable to surrender any land, such person owns or holds lands in excess of the ceiling area:\nxxx xxx xxx xxx\n55. This application was, however, rejected by the Land Board. Against the order of the Land Board C.R.P. No. 3786 of 1976 was filed before the High Court. This civil revision was disposed of by the High Court on 11th September, 1979 by making inter alia the following observation:\nIt is brought to my notice that the question which the petitioner sought to raise before the Land Board i.e. whether the property belongs to the joint family or to the Maharaja, is now before this Court in appeal in A.S. No. 210 of 1979. In the circumstances I think interests of justice will be served if I direct that the petitioner can move for relief under\nSection 85(9)\nof the Kerala Land Reforms Act on the basis of the decision in the appeal. The Land Board will decide the question of surrender of excess lands on the basis of the decision of the High Court in the appeal. The Land Board would be bound by\nthe said decision\nand will have accordingly to modify the order if it is so necessary. Till the decision in the appeal and in case in the appeal the decision is in favour of the petitioner, till the Land Board takes a decision on the petition which the petitioner had filed before the Land Board afresh in accordance with the directions given herein, the Land Board shall not distribute any excess lands which they have come in possession on the basis of the order passed against the 1st respondent. Nor shall the State the 16th respondent herein alienate any such lands which might have come into their possession on the basis of the decision in the ceiling case against the Ist respondent. The State shall not do anything which might prejudice the right of the successful party in the appeal.\n56. We shall now consider the second contention\nreferred to above\nraised on behalf of Respondent No. 1.\n57. It may be recapitulated that there are only two alternatives which fall for consideration with regard to the nature of the properties in suit, namely, whether they are joint family property as asserted by the appellant or personal properties of respondent No. 1 as asserted by him. As regards the properties being joint family properties apart from what has been discussed above, it may further be noticed that the Trial Court recorded a categorical finding not only that no title deeds or any other documentary evidence to prove the source of acquisition of these properties had been produced on behalf of the appellant, even PW.1, the father of the appellant who appeared as a witness on his behalf had to admit that he did not know whether these properties were settled in favour of anyone and that he had not seen any record to show that these properties belonged to the tarwad as alleged in the plaint. On the other hand, respondent No. 1, inter aha, produced settlement registers marked as Ex. B-10 to B-14, State Budget Ex. B 15 and.B-16, the Kandukrishi Proclamation dated 27th May, 1949 and Circular Ex. B-30 with regard to the properties shown in Schedule A to the plaint indicating that they belonged to the Sirkar or State. He also produced Ex.B-17 indicating that maintenance of the palace was being done by the State with the funds of the State exchequer. With regard to securities and shares in the name of respondent No. 1 and the items of jewellery in his custody, the Trial Court has held that there was nothing on the record to show that they had been acquired with tarwad funds or that the tarwad had any interest in the same. The fact that the lacuna pointed out by the Trial Court as aforesaid did exist could not successfully be assailed on behalf of the appellant either before the High Court or even before us:\n58. The Rulers of Travancore and Cochin with the concurrence and guarantee of the Government of India entered into a covenant dated 27th May, 1949 for the formation of the United State of Travancore and Cochin. This covenant was proved in the suit and marked as Ex. A-2. Article IV of the covenant provided that there shall be a Raj Pramukh for the United State. Article XV which is relevant for the purposes of the instant case provided as herender:-\n(1) The Ruler of each Covenanting State shall be entitled to the full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties (as distinct from State properties) belonging to him immediately before the appointed day.\n(2) He shall furnish to the Government of India in the Ministry of States before the first day of September, 1949 as inventory of all immovable property, securities and cash balances held by him as such private property.\n(3) If any dispute arises as to whether any item of property is the private property of the Ruler or State property, it shall be referred to such person as the Government of India may nominate in consultation with the Ruler of Travancore or Cochin as the case may be and the decision of that person shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.\nRespondent No. 1 furnished the relevant inventory contemplated by the aforesaid Article XV. Copy of Government proceedings consequent upon the aforesaid covenant and furnishing of the inventory was marked as Ex.A-3. It starts by saying:-\nThe question of the private properties of His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore was engaging the attention of the Government of India. The conclusion reached and agreed to by this Government and embodied in three statements showing:\n(i) Immovable properties recognised as the Private Property of His Highness the Maharaja of Travacore.\n(ii) Immovable Properties to be handed over to the State Government, and\n(iii) Cash balance and securities recognised as His Highness' private property.\n59. Thereafter are to be found the lists containing details of the aforesaid three categories of property. It has hot been disputed before us that these lists include the properties in suit.\n60. White Paper on Indian States published by the Government of India, Ministry of States, in its part-VII dealing with 'Settlement of Ruler's Private Properties' contains in paragraphs 156 and 157, inter alia, the following statement:\n156. The Instruments of Merger and the Covenants establishing the various Unions of States, are in the nature of over-all settlements with the Rulers who have executed them. While they provide for the integration of States and for the transfer of power from the Rulers, they also guarantee to the Rulers privy purse, succession to gaddi, rights and privileges and full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties belonging to them, as distinct from State properties. The position about the privy purses guaranteed or assured to the Rulers is set out in details in Part XI. The provisions of the Constitution bearing on the rights, privileges and dignities of Rulers and their succession to their respective gaddis are also explained in that Part. So far as their Private properties are concerned, the Rulers were required to furnish by a specified date inventories of immovable property, securities and cash balances claimed by them as private property. The settlement of any dispute arising in respect of the properties claimed by a Ruler was to be by reference to an arbitrator appointed by the Government of India.\n157. In the past the Rulers made no distinction between private and State property; they could freely use for personal purposes any property owned by their respective States.\n61. Just as the Rulers of Travancore and Cochin had entered into the aforesaid covenant, 35 States in Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand regions agreed on March 13, 1948 to unite themselves into one State which was to be called the United State of Vindhya Pradesh. Article XI of the said covenant as quoted in Vishnu Pratap Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. 1990 (Supp.) SCC 43, read as hereunder:\n(1) The Ruler of each Covenanting State shall be entitled 'to' the full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties (as distinct from State properties) belonging to him on the date of his making over the Administration of the State to the Raj Pramukh.\n(2) He shall furnish to the Raj Pramukh before May 1, 1948 an inventory of all the immovable properties, securities and cash balances held by him as such private property.\n(3) If any dispute arises as to whether any item of property is the private property of the Ruler or State property, it shall be referred to a Judicial Officer to be nominated by the Government of India, and the decision of that person shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.\n62. A dispute arose in regard to a house built by one of the 35 Rulers, namely, the Ruler of Chattarpur. Dealing with the effect of the Covenant in the background of the Instrument of Accession which each of the Rulers including the Maharaja of Travancore had from time to time signed in exercise of his sovereignty in and over his State, it was held in the case of Vishnu Pratap Singh (supra):\nDespite the distinction drawn in Article XI, there was in reality no distinction between State property and the property privately owned by a Ruler, since the Ruler was the owner of all the property in the State. For the purposes of arrangement of finance, however, such a distinction was practically being observed by all Rulers. The apparent effect of the covenant was that all the property in the State vested in the United State of Vindhya Pradesh except private property which was to remain with the Rulers. As is evident, the Ruler was required under Article XI to furnish to the Raj Pramukh before May 1, 1948 an inventory of all immovable properties, securities and cash balances held by him as such private property. Conceivably, on a dispute arising as to whether any item of property was or was not the private property of the Ruler and hence State property, it was required to be referred to a Judicial Officer to be nominated by the Government of India and the decision of that officer was to be final and binding on all parties concerned, \n\n\n\n xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n \n\nThe Factual undenied position is that the Ruler of Chattarpur on July 5, 1948 (vide Ex. D-13-5) submitted a list to the Raj Pramukh of the United State of Vindhya Pradesh of his private properties, and in the said list the house in dispute, namely, Gulab Rai Wala house, was shown as the private property of the Ruler (by the then Maharaja Shri Bhawani Singh Je Deo). In the following month, on August 25, 1948, the said Maharaja Shri Bhawani Singh Ju Deo made a gift of the house in dispute in favour of his father-in-law Dewan Shanker Pratap Singh (now deceased and represented by his legal representatives- appellants). His gift has become the subject matter of dispute in the suit, out of which this appeal has arisen, for grounds to be taken note of later at an appropriate stage,\n\n xxx xxx xxx xxx\nTaking thus the totality of these circumstances in view, we are driven to the conclusion that the High Court committed an error that the Ruler lost his sovereign right to earmark the property in dispute as his private property after May 1, 1948, or that the said property vested in the State with effect from that date or that the letter Ex. P-9 of Shri N.M. Buch and the lists attached thereto, had the effect of divesting the appellants of the title to the property in dispute in favour of the State with effect from that date. In that strain, factual position having not been denied, the validity of the gift dated August 25, 1948, cannot be questioned on the grounds enumerated in the plaint, due to exercise of sovereign power of the Ruler in the grant thereof at that point of time.\n63. In view of the foregoing discussion, there can, therefore, be no manner of doubt that the properties in suit were not joint family properties as asserted by the appellant but were the personal properties of respondent No. 1 as asserted by him. Consequently no exception can be taken to the dismissal of the suit filed by the appellant by the Courts below and Civil Appeal No. 534 of 1983 filed by the appellant deserves to be dismissed. For the same reason, Civil Appeal No. 535 of 1983 filed by defendants No. 32, 33 and 34 claiming a larger share in the properties in suit on partition treating them to be joint family properties as asserted by the appellant also deserves to be dismissed.\n64. We may, at this place, point out that reliance was placed by learned Counsel for the appellant on certain decisions laying down that if joint Hindu family property was by custom or otherwise impartible, its nature of partible joint Hindu family property will get revived on the commencement of the\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nand the\nKerala Joint Hindu Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975\n. Reference was also made to several passages from Chapter 12 of Hindu Law by S.V. Gupte dealing with impartible property including the circumstances in which impartible property becomes capable of partition. However, in view of our finding that the properties in suit were not joint family properties as alleged by the appellant but were the personal properties of respondent No. 1, we do not consider it necessary to deal with them. Neither any principle of law nor any authority has been brought to our notice in view whereof personal properties of respondent No. 1 could get transformed into joint Hindu family properties wherein the appellant could acquire an interest. Even if we proceed on the basis that the personal properties held by respondent No. 1 continued to retain the character of impartibility and they became partible subsequently, it would, in no way, advance the case of the appellant inasmuch as it has not been shown to us that the appellant would be an heir of respondent No. 1 with regard to his personal properties. Apparently such properties would on his demise be governed either by testamentary disposition or would devolve on his personal heirs.\n65. Another point urged by learned Counsel for the appellant was that the covenant could not confer any right in favour of respondent No. 1 which he did not otherwise possess nor could it take away the rights of the members of the joint Hindu family by accepting the properties in suit to be the personal properties of respondent No. 1. Suffice it to say so far as this submission is concerned that as has been held above, the properties in suit had been earmarked by respondent No. 1 as his personal properties which he was competent to do as a sovereign and the Government by accepting or approving the list of properties submitted by him as his personal properties in pursuance of the covenant did not purport on its own to create any right in favour of respondent No. 1 in such properties. The Government could have disputed the list submitted by respondent No. 1 but it chose not to do so and the assertion of respondent No. 1 that the properties in suit were his personal properties was accepted;\n66. In view of the foregoing discussion, both the Civil Appeals fail and are dismissed but there shall be no order as to costs.",

The respondent filed a review\napplication alleging that the partition deed dt. 17th March,\n1963 was  not in  fact a  deed of  partition but  merely  an\nagreement between  the parties to partition the property and\nthere was  no actual  partition by metes and bounds and that\nthe respondent continued to remain co-owner and co-sharer of\nthe property in suit.\n     The High  Court allowed the review application and held\nthat the  mere allotment  of shares  by\t the  said  deed  of\npartition did  not amount  to partition by metes and bounds,\nset aside  the judgment\t and decree  of the  lower Appellate\nCourt and dismissed the suit.\n     In the  appeal to this Court on behalf of the appellant\nit was\tcontended that\tthe land  in dispute was allotted to\nthe vendor  in accordance  with the  deed of partition (Ext.\n3/1) and  shown in  map\t (Ext.\t3/2)  effected\tbetween\t the\nparties on  17.3.58 and\t this  has  been  mentioned  in\t the\nsale:deed (Ext.\t 1) and,  therefore, the judgment and decree\nof the\tHigh Court  is not in accordance with law and should\nbe set aside.\n     Dismissing the appeal,\n^\n     HELD: 1.  There is\t no pleading regarding the partition\nof the\tproperty No.  164 nor  there is\t any pleading to the\neffect that  the disputed  mud wall  with the khaprail on it\nwas ever in possession of appellant's vendor before the sale\nof the\tland in question in favour of the appellant. [1034H;\n1035A-B]\n     2. On  a consideration  of the evidence on record it is\nestablished that the alleged encroachment by construction of\nkuchha\twall   and  khaprail   over  it\t  is  not  a  recent\nconstruction as\t alleged to  have been\tmade in May 1961. On\nthe other hand it is crystal clear from the evidence of PW 1\nand DW\t1 that the disputed wall with khaprail existed there\non the\tdisputed site  for a long time i.e., 28 years before\nand the wall and the khaprail have been affected by salt, as\ndeposed by  these two witnesses. The Court Amin's report 57C\nalso shows the said walls and khaprail to be 25-30 years old\nin its present condition. The High Court rightly came to the\nfinding that though the partition deed was\n1031\nexecuted by  the parties yet there was no partition by metes\nand bounds.  Moreover, there  is no  whisper in\t the  plaint\nabout the  partition of the property in question between the\nco-sharers by  metes and  bounds nor  there is\tany averment\nthat the  suit property\t fell to share of appellant's vendor\nand he was ever in possession of the disputed property since\nthe  date  of  partition  till\tthe  date  of  sale  to\t the\nappellant. The\tappellant has  singularly faild to prove the\ncase as pleaded in the plaint. [1037C-E]\n     3. Without considering the deposition of Respondent No.\n1 as well as the report of the Amin 57C the Additional Civil\nJudge wrongly  held that the respondent failed to prove that\nthe wall  in dispute  and the  khaprail existed for the last\nmore than  12 years before the suit. The Civil Judge further\nheld on\t surmises as \"may be that the wall and khaprail have\nnot been  raised on May 1961 as is the plaintiff's case, but\nthey are  recent constructions.\"  This decision of the lower\nAppellate Court\t is wholly  incorrect being  contrary to the\nevidence on record.

Singh,   R.P.  Singh\t  and  D.S.  Mehra  for\t the\nAppellant.\nL.P. Vats and S.P. Panday for the Respondent.\n     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n     B.C. Ray,\tJ. This\t appeal by  special leave is against\nthe judgment  and decree  dated 21st  December, 1970  of the\nAllahabad High\tCourt in  Second Appeal\t No.  2757  of\t1963\nallowing the appeal on setting aside the judgment and decree\nof the\tcourt of appeal below and dismissing the plaintiff's\nsuit.\nThe plaintiff  Hari Chand\t@ Harish  Chandra instituted\nsuit No.610  of 1961  in  Court\t of  the  Munsif,  Agra\t for\nrecovery of  possession of  the disputed  land shown  in red\ncolour attached\t to the\t plan marked  with letters  GCDH  on\ndemolition of the unauthorised constructions made thereon by\nthe defendant  alleging inter alia that the plaintiff became\nowner in  possession of\t a piece  of land measuring 1580 Sq.\nft. situated  at Sultanpura,  Agra Cantt.  designated as No.\n164A, and\n1032\nshown in  the plan attached thereto with letters A, B, C, D,\nE, F  on the  basis of a registered sale deed dated 9th May,\n1961, from Ramji Lal owner of the said property. It has been\nfurther alleged\t that  the  plaintiff  started\tto  build  a\ncompound wall  over and\t around his land after his purchase.\nThe defendant  taking undue  advantage\tof  the\t plaintiff's\ntemporary  absence  from  Agra,\t wrongfully  encroached\t and\ntrespassed  along   the\t whole\t Northern  length   of\t the\nplaintiff's land  measuring North  to South  about 4 ft. and\nEast to West about 62 1/2 ft. by hurriedly raising a low mud\nwall and  extending his khaprail thatch over it. It has been\nshown in the attached plain in red colour with letters G, C,\nD  &  H.  It  has  been\t further  alleged  that\t inspite  of\nplaintiff's objection against the said wrongful encroachment\nand trespass  the defendant  did not  pay any heed to it. It\nhas also  been pleaded\tthat the cause of action of the suit\nprimarily  arose  on  or  about\t 22nd  May,  1961  when\t the\ndefendant made\tthe encroachment  and wrongful constructions\nover the  plaintiff's land  as well  as it arose on 4.6.1961\nwhen the defendant failed to remove the encroachment inspite\nof  the\t  plaintiff's  notice.\tHence  this  suit  has\tbeen\ninstituted.\nThe defendant  filed a  written statement\tdenying that\nthe plaintiff  was owner  of the  land shown  by GCDH in the\nplan attached  to the  plaint. The defendant also denied the\ncorrectness of\tthe sale  deed dated  9.5.1961. It  has been\nstated that  the land  marked GCDH as shown in red colour in\nthe plan  attached to  the  plaint  never  belonged  to\t the\nplaintiff. The wall and khaprail belonging to the contesting\ndefendant have\tbeen existing  at their\t present site  since\ntime  immemorial.   The\t plaintiff's   allegation  that\t the\ncontesting defendant  has constructed  the wall and extended\nthe khaprail  (tiled roof)  in May 1961 is totally wrong and\nbaseless. It  has been\tfurther stated\tthat he did not make\nany new\t construction. The  defendant also  stated that\t the\nplaintiff illegally  tried to remove his kutcha wall and the\ntiled roof  situate at\tthe  place  marked  G,\tC,  D  &  H.\nAccordingly, on\t 25.5.1961 the\tcontesting defendant  gave a\nnotice to the plaintiff mentioning the actual facts to which\nhe gave\t a wrong  reply. The plaintiff's allegation that the\nwall and  tiled roof  of the  defendant\t encroach  upon\t the\nplaintiff's land  is totally  wrong, false  and baseless. It\nhas been  stated that the wall and tiled roof belongs to the\ncontesting defendant  and the  eaves of tiled roof have been\nat the\tsame place  since time\timmemoral where\t they are at\npresent. He  has been  regularly and openly enjoying all the\nproprietary rights  and\t rights\t of  adverse  possession  in\nrespect of  the\t land  aforesaid.  Under\nSec.\t142\nof\t the\nLimitation Act, the contesting defendant became the absolute\nowner of the land in dispute on the\n1033\nbasis of  the adverse  possession as well and he has a right\nof easement  in the  form of flowing of water from the tiled\nroof. The  kuchha house\t No.164 belonging  to the contesting\ndefendant has  been existing at its site exactly in the same\ncondition  in\twhich  it   was\t built\tby  the\t defendant's\ngrandfather. The  eaves have been dropped at that very place\nand the\t khaprail has also been existing at that very place.\nThe contesting\tdefendant did  not make any new construction\nas alleged by plaintiff in the plaint. Property Nos. 163 and\n164 consisted  of kuchha  houses. The  contesting  defendant\ndemolished the\tProperty No. 163 which had come to his share\nand got\t in pucca  built. Property  No. 164 is a khaprail in\nwhich the  contesting defendant\t is living and was living at\nthe time  of partition. The defendant therefore, states that\nthe suit is liable to be dismissed.\nThird Additional Munsif, Agra after hearing the parties\nand also on a consideration and appraisement of the evidence\non record  held that  the plaintiff  was the  owner  of\t the\nproperty described  in the  plaint by the boundaries but the\ndefendant has  not trespassed  over his\t land  and  has\t not\nconstructed a new wall or khaprail. It has been further held\nthat the  plaintiff failed to prove the case of trespass and\nencroachment. The suit was accordingly dismissed with costs.\nAgainst  this   judgment  and   decree  the   plaintiff\npreferred an  appeal being  numbered as\t Civil Appeal 220 of\n1963 in\t the court  of District Judge, Agra. This appeal was\nallowed by the IInd Addl. Civil Judge, Agra holding that the\ndefendant failed  to prove  that the wall in dispute and the\nkhaprail existed  for the last more than 12 years before the\nsuit, even  though it  was not\tproved that the khaprail had\nbeen raised  in May  1961 as  was the case of the plaintiff,\nbut they  are recent  construction. It was further held that\neven if the defendant's wall and khaprail are old ones he is\nnot entitled to maintain them after the same was allotted to\nRamji Lal  in the  deed of  partition dated 3.3.1958. It has\nbeen  further\theld  that  the\t plaintiff  is\tentitled  to\npossession after  demolition  of  the  construction  on\t the\nportion found  encroached by  defendant.  The  judgment\t and\ndegree of the court below was set aside.\nAgainst this judgment and decree Second Appeal No. 2757\nof 1963\t was filed  before the High Court at Allahabad. This\nappeal was  dismissed by  judgment and\torder dated 8.9.1963\nand the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court was\naffirmed.\nA review  application No. 269 of 1969 for the review of\nthe said\n1034\njudgment was  filed before the High Court on the ground\nthat the  alleged partition  deed dated 17th March, 1963 was\nnot in\tfact a\tdeed of\t partition but\tmerely an  agreement\nbetween the  parties to partition the property and there was\nno actual  partition by\t metes\tand  bounds.  The  defendent\ncontinued to  remain co-owner  and co-sharer of the property\nin suit.  The decree  passed in\t the said  suit\t is  neither\npossible  nor\tpermissible  under   the  law.\tThis  review\napplication was allowed by judgment and order dated December\n9, 1970 setting aside the judgment dated 8th September, 1969\nand directing  the appeal  to be listed for further hearing.\nAccordingly on\t21.12.1970  the\t appeal\t was  heard  by\t the\nlearned judge  who held that the mere allotment of shares by\nthe said  deed of  partition did  not amount to partition by\nmetes and  bounds. The\tappeal of  the defendant was allowed\nand the\t judgment and  decree of  the lower  appellate court\nwere set aside and the suit was dismissed.\nAgainst this  judgment and decree the instant appeal on\nspecial leave  was  filed  by  the  plaintiff.\tThe  learned\ncounsel for  the plaintiff  tried to urge before us that the\nland in\t dispute marked\t as GCDH in the plan was allotted to\nthe share  of the plaintiff's vendor Ramji Lal in accordance\nwith the deed of partition (Ext. 3/1) and shown in map (Ext.\n3/2) effected  between the parties on 17.3.1958 and this has\nbeen mentioned\tin the\tsale deed (Ext. 1) executed by Ramji\nLal,  one  of  the  co-sharers\tof  the\t property.  It\thas,\ntherefore, been\t submitted that\t the judgment  and decree of\nthe High  Court is  not in accordance with law and it should\nbe set\taside. This  contention advanced  on behalf  of\t the\nplaintiff cannot  be sustained\tin as  much as\tthere is  no\npleading in  the plaint\t that the disputed property shown in\nred colour  and marked\tas GCDH fell within the allotment of\nthe plaintiff on the basis of the deed of partition executed\nin 1958 between the plaintiff's vendor Ramji Lal and his two\nother brothers-Daulat  Ram and\tBishambhar Nath. It was also\nbeen not pleaded that the disputed mud wall and the Khaprail\nover it\t were all  along in  possession of his vendor before\nthe sale of the said land measuring 1580 Sq. ft appertaining\nto Property  No. 164A.\tThe plaintiff's\t case is that he got\npossession of  the land he purchased including the suit land\non May 9, 1961 and the defendant illegally trespassed on the\nsaid portion  of land  marked in  red  colour  in  the\tplan\nattached to  the plaint\t and hurriedly constructed a low mud\nwall and  extended his\tkhaprail thatch\t over it  on May 22,\n1961 and so the suit for recovery of possession of this land\non demolition of the unauthorised construction put up by the\ndefendant was  brought. There  is no  pleading regarding the\npartition of the Property No. 164 between\n1035\nRamji Lal  and his two brothers nor there is any pleading to\nthe effect  that the  disputed mud wall with the khaprail on\nit was ever in possession of his vendor Ramji Lal before the\nsale of\t the land in question in favour of the plaintiff. On\nthe other  hand, the  defendant strongly  and  categorically\nstated in his written statement that the mud wall along with\nkhaprail were  in existence there for a long time and he was\nliving\tin  the\t said  khaprail\t to  the  knowledge  of\t the\nplaintiff's vendor.  He also  denied that  he made  any\t new\nconstruction of the wall on 22nd May, 1961 as alleged by the\nplaintiff. He  also stated  that the wall and the tiled roof\nbelonged to  the defendant  and the  existence of  the tiled\nroof had  been at the same place in the same condition for a\nlong time  long before. the partition deed made in 1958. The\ndefendant also\tstated in  his written\tstatement that\tmore\nthan twenty years before private parition took place amongst\nthe defendant and his brothers Bish ambar Lal and Ramji Lal.\nProperty  No.  163  and\t 164  had  come\t to  his  share.  He\ndemolished  the\t  Property  No.\t  163,\tand  he\t made  pucca\nconstruction therein.  Property No.  164 is khaprail wherein\nthe contesting\tdefendant is  living and  was also living at\nthe time of partition.\nThe plaintiff  has examined  three witnesses  including\nhimself and his vendor Ramji Lal. P.W. 1 Ramji Lal stated in\nhis deposition\tthat the  portion shown\t in red\t in plan No.\n36/4 Ka came to his share and defendant Daulat Ram was never\nin possession  of this\tred portion  after partition. It was\nalso his  evidence that\t at the time of sale, wall belonging\nto Daulat  Ram did  not exist over the portion showed in red\ncolour. In  cross-examination he said that there was a tiled\nshed towards  the north\t of the\t land in dispute. Daulat Ram\nused to\t live therein.\tAll these  three  portions  had\t old\ntiles. There  was a  chhappar over the portion shown in red.\nTiled roof  was made  after the\t fire accident.\t It happened\nabout 28  years back.  The land in dispute has been affected\nby salt\t and the  adjoining  kuchha  walls  have  also\tbeen\naffected by  salt. P.W.\t 2 Harish  Chandra,  the  plaintiff,\nstated in  his evidence\t that he was not present at the time\nencroachment was  made by  constructing a wall. Some persons\ntold   him   about   the   extension   of   the\t  wall.\t  On\ncrossexamination he  stated that  pucca rooms  belonging  to\nDaulat Ram stand at No. 163. He cannot say if they have been\nin existence  15-20 years.  It is  the evidence of defendant\nDaulat Ram, D.W. 1, that the wall in dispute has been in its\nplace since  the time  he attained  the age  of\t discretion.\nThere has  been tiled roof for the last about 28 years back.\nBefore that  there was\ta thatched  shed.  It  is  also\t his\nevidence that  his mother effected partition about 28 years.\nThe wall in dispute was in existence when this partition was\neffected. It has been existing\n1036\nin the\tsame condition\tsince then.  It is also his evidence\nthat his mother got the partition effected 28 years back. He\nalso stated  in crossexamination  that he  did not affix his\nthumb impression  on the  plan\tprepared  at  the  time\t the\npartition deed\twas executed.  No measurements\twere done at\nthe time  the plan was prepared. D.W. 2 Khunni Lal a retired\noverseer stated\t in cross-examination  that he had given his\nopinion that  the wall in dispute belonged to Daulat Ram and\nthat the  flow\tof  its\t water\ton  the\t southern  side\t was\nreasonable.\nOn a consideration of these evidences it is quite clear\nthat the  disputed kachha  wall and  the khaprail over it is\nnot a  new construction,  but existed  for over 28 years and\nthe defendant has been living therein as has been deposed to\nby Ramji  Lal vendor  of the  plaintiff who  admitted in his\nevidence that  the land\t in dispute and the adjoining kachha\nwalls had  been affected  by salt  and the chhappar over the\nportion shown  in red  was tiled  roof constructed  about 28\nyears back.  This is  also supported  by the evidence of the\ndefendant, D.W. 1, that the wall in dispute was in existence\nwhen the  partition was effected i.e., 28 years before. On a\nconsideration of  these evidences  the Trial  Court  rightly\nheld that  the defendant had not trespassed over the land in\nquestion nor  he had constructed a new wall or khaprail. The\ntrial court also considered the report 57C by the court Amin\nand held  that\tthe  wall  in  question\t was  not  a  recent\nconstruction but  it appeared 25-30 years old in its present\ncondition as  evident from  the said  report. The  suit\t was\ntherefore  dismissed.\tThe  lower  appellate  court  merely\nconsidered the\tpartition deed\tand map\t Exts. 3/1  and\t 3/2\nrespectively and held that the disputed property fell to the\nshare of  the plaintiff's  vendor and the correctness of the\npartition map  was not\tchallenged in the written statement.\nThe court  of appeal  below also referred to Amin's map 47 A\nwhich showed the encroached portion in red colour as falling\nwithin the  share of  plaintiff's vendor,  and held that the\ndefendant encroached  on this  portion of land marked in red\ncolour, without at all considering the clear evidence of the\ndefendant himself that the wall and the khaprail in question\nexisted for  the last  28 years\t and the  defendant has been\nliving there  all along.  P.W.\t1  Ramji  Lal  himself\talso\nadmitted that  the wall existed for about 28 years as stated\nby the\tdefendant and  the kachha walls and the khaprail has\nbeen effected by salt. The lower appellate court though held\nthat P.W.  1 Ramji  Lal admitted  in cross-examination\tthat\ntowards the  north of  the land\t in dispute was the khaprail\ncovered room  of Daulat\t Ram in\t which Daulat Ram lived, but\nthis does  not mean  that the wall in dispute exists for the\nlast any  certain number  of years,  although it can be said\nthat it is not a\n1037\nrecent construction.  Without considering  the deposition of\ndefendant No.  1 as  well as the report of the Amin 57 C the\nIInd Addl. Civil Judge, Agra wrongly held that the defendant\nfailed to  prove that  the wall\t in dispute and the khaprail\nexisted for the last more than 12 years before the suit. The\nCivil Judge  further held  on surmises\tas \"may\t be that the\nwall and  khaprail have\t not been  raised in May, 1961 as is\nthe plaintiff's\t case, but  they are  recent constructions.\"\nThis decision  of  the\tcourt  of  appeal  below  is  wholly\nincorrect being contrary to the evidences on record.\nOn a consideration of all the evidences on record it is\nclearly\t established   that  the   alleged  encroachment  by\nconstruction of\t kuchha wall  and khaprail  over it is not a\nrecent construction  as alleged\t to have  been made  in\t May\n1961. On  the other  hand, it  is  crystal  clear  from\t the\nevidences of Ramji Lal P.W. 1 and Daulat Ram D.W. 1 that the\ndisputed wall  with khaprail  existed there  in the disputed\nsite for  a long  time, that is 28 years before and the wall\nand the khaprail have been affected by salt as deposed to by\nthese two  witnesses. Moreover\tthe court Amin's report 57 C\nalso shows the said walls and khaprail to be 25-30 years old\nin its present condition. The High Court has clearly came to\nthe finding  that though  the partition deed was executed by\nthe parties  yet there was no partition by metes and bounds.\nMoreover there\tis  no\twhisper\t in  the  plaint  about\t the\npartition of the property in question between the co-sharers\nby metes  and bounds nor there is any averment that the suit\nproperty fell  to the  share of plaintiff's vendor Ramji Lal\nand Ramji  Lal\twas  ever  in  possession  of  the  disputed\nproperty since\tthe date  of partition till the date of sale\nto the\tplaintiff. The\tplaintiff has  singularly failed  to\nprove his case as pleaded in the plaint.\nIn the  premises aforesaid\t the appeal  fails and it is\ndismissed. There will however be no order as to costs.\nA.P.J.\t\t\t\t\t   Appeal dismissed.\n1038",

Sahai\nBench:\nR.M. Sahai\nJUDGMENT\n\n \n\nR.M. Sahai, J.\n1. Renewal of Nazul land leases of Civil Lines, Allahabad, sprawled over an area of approximately 662 acres, one of the poshest localities of the town, renowned for its quiet serenity, famous for its, till recently, sophisticated looking marketing centre, inhabited by Judges, Lawyers, doctors, educationists, journalists, businessmen and now by a neo-rich class as well with no ostensible means but affluent and powerful, least but no less important out-house dwellers with no right or title but vote bank, has been eluding solution for more than two decades now. If the first phase beginning from March, 1959, when government issued order laying down conditions for renewal of leases, came to an end in April, 1965 when government directed the District Magistrate to renew leases of those who complied with modified conditions was marked with representations and objections by lease-holders' Association to what appeared to them to be unreasonable restrictions on right of alienation and demand of exhorbitant rate of ground rent and premium then the second and third phases namely, from 1965 to 1976 and 1976 to 1981 were marked with spurt of legislations and government orders directed towards urban socialisation with its resultant effect on narrowing down of terms and conditions for renewal. With swift shift in socio and economic set up of the society, specially after 1965, the government changed its policy and the concessions granted in 1960 and 1965 were not only withdrawn by superseding those orders but fresh conditions reducing area and enhancing rent and premium, were laid down. Even in those cases where lessees had complied with terms and conditions and order had been passed, leases were not renewed thus furnishing foundation for invoking doctrine of promissory estoppel, developed by English and American Courts as rule of equity, given new dimensions by our Supreme Court by extending it against government and Corporations not only as a weapon of defence but as cause of action as well. But the most pungent and venomous attack was on favour showered by government on few with power sack or money bag and renewal of their leases thus denying equality guaranteed by part III of the Constitution to other similarly situated. Creation of parallel heirarchy by defining family and reducing area, acting arbitrarily in implementation of government orders were vigorously pressed. Principle of offer made by government and its acceptance by lessees by complying with terms and conditions thus resulting in binding contract was also put forward. Failure to issue notices to individual, lessees refusal of renewal of leases resulting in special injury, binding nature of executive orders, fairness in government action, reasonable behaviour by public authorities who have no unfettered discretion were also advanced by various counsel who urged that government should be pinned down to its earlier promise and assurances as it was government which was guilty of unwarranted procrastination. Paradoxically what appeared to be unreasonable and exhorbitant in 1959 and 1960 delayed the matters for so long .is now the demand, the relief sought in these petitions. How and why the policy of government underwent change; what effect it had on right of lease-holders; can the government be held to be bound by the promise extended by -it in 1959 and 1960; is the government guilty of picking and choosing lessees without there being any intelligent differentia, and, therefore, it should be directed to renew leases of others as well, are the orders issued after 1976 had being contrary to law of the land; is renewal of lease of Nazul land a concession which cannot be enforced through Court etc.; can Mandamus be issued in 1986 directing the government to do what it ought to have done in 1959 or 1960 or even in 1965, could petitioners approach this court for issue of Mandamus in 1981; are issues which emerge out of orders passed by government from time to time and the submissions advanced by learned counsel for parties.\nGist of Govt. Orders (i) 1959 to 1965 :--\n2. Prior to adverting to rival submissions it is necessary to narrate, in brief, the background in which the government issued various orders declaring its policy in this regard. In 1958 Collector, Allahabad issued notices to various lessees whose leases were expiring in that year to surrender and leave the lease land and hand over vacant possession of the same to him as representative of State Government of Uttar Pradesh who were successors to the right and interest of the Secretary of State for India in Council. This must have caused flutter and number of eminent citizens of Allahabad, which had been once the nerve centre of freedom struggle, represented the hardship which was, likely to arise to them from such harsh step. According to supplementary counter-affidavit filed on behalf of State on 4th February, 1986 the Government in consequence of representation to the Chief Minister reconsidered the matter in March, 1958 and ordered that case for renewal of leases may be taken individually and possession may be taken only if lessee surrendered or the lease stood terminated in absence of any request from lessee for grant of fresh lease. Fresh representations were made resulting in what may be termed as beginning of first phase from 23rd April, 1959 when Secretary to the Government informed the District Magistrate, Allahabad that he was directed to say, 'that Government have carefully considered the question of renewal of leases of Nazul lands in Civil Lines, Allahabad which have either expired already but have not been renewed so far, or which are due to expire within the next 5 or 6 years. In consideration of the numerous representations which were made to them from time to time from the existing lease-holders, and their long association with the City, Government have decided, as a special case, to grant fresh lease to them on the terms and conditions given below, provided that they put in applications for renewal of leases at once or within a reasonable time of the expiry of the lease, to be indicated by you, but not exceeding three months from the date of this order, or the expiry of the lease, as the case may be'. It mentioned in detail the terms and conditions on which the leases were to be renewed. On receipt of it the District Magistrate issued a press note on 21st May, 1959 which led to formation of Allahabad Lease-holders Association, Allahabad which while thanking the government for its decision to renew leases voiced its feeling on exhorbitant demand in view of the general economic condition of lease-holders. It was pointed out that proposed levy of premium at the slab rate system for each acre in possession of lease-holders for residential purposes was unparalleled. While conceding retention of big compound was against socialistic pattern of society it was suggested that authorities may be directed to devise practical ways and means for the same but there should be no levy at all on the land which was necessarily appurtenant to any building. Request was made for inspection of sites by Town Planner before any area was declared as surplus. As conditions of majority of lessees was economically not better, it was claimed that rate of premium be reduced, and payment may be realised in instalments. Construction of Community latrines was opposed since there was no sewer line. Ground rent was suggested to be enhanced by not more than 50 per cent. Request was made for treating Trusts, Registered Societies, Religious and Educational and other institutions differently than others. Some house-owners also met the then Prime Minister Late Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, who appears to have come to Allahabad in November, or December, 1959 who sent a letter on 25th December, 1959 copy of which has been filed as Annexure '17' to Supplementary Affidavit, to the then Minister in U.P. Government indicating him that although he had nothing to do with it yet the terms of renewal did appear to be severe. Needless to say that it had immediate impact and the government while retaining G.O. of 1959 issued another order on 7th July, 1960 as a special concession, by which it reduced the rate of premium on first three acres by Rs. 2,000/- in each slab. It also permitted payment in five instalments, and reduced the ground rent to Rs. 100/- per acre. Insistence on construction of Community latrines was given up till sewer line was laid. Lessees were granted three months time to get leases renewed. But instead of complying with it the lease-holders Association with fond of wresting something more made another representation in August, 1960. Nothing came out of it. In 1961 the Association sent another representation to the Chief Minister-highlighting its grievances against delay and claiming renewal of leases on terms and conditions indicated therein. With every representation the lease-holders association became more exacting in its demand. On 21st March, 1963 the government issued third Order declaring the rates of premium for commercial sites. On 3rd December, 1965 the government after considering representations made to government by the association issued a fresh order indicating the terms and conditions for renewal of leases for residential and commercial purposes, to avoid hardship to the lessees. In respect of the former it was stated that rates of premium and annual rent shall be as fixed by the order dated 7th July, 1960. The payment was also to be made in five equal yearly instalments but special cases could be examined by the commissioner, Allahabad Division, Allahabad for making necessary recommendation to government for enhancing the number of instalments. Various clauses of its are important, which shall be referred as and when necessary. With this ended the first phase with emphasis on renewal of leases of existing lesses on payment of at least one instalment, within one month of the receipt of intimation by the lessee from the Collector, or within three months of the date of the expiry of the lease whichever is earlier; And the deposit was to be deemed to be proper , step on the part of the lessee to get a fresh lease executed by the lessor. The order further provided for renewal of leases of existing lessees if they deposited first instalment, 'within one month of the date of receipt of intimation by him from Collector, Allahabad.' The order of 1965, therefore, made a distinction between those whose leases had expired and others by describing them as sitting and existing lessees.\nGist of Govt. Orders (ii) 1966 to 1981 :\n3. On 16th February, 1966 U.P. Awas Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam was enacted for providing house sites and construction of building. On 4th November, 1968 the government order dated 3rd December, 1965 was modified and it was directed that leases of joint lessees should be renewed as far as possible for one acre only. Sub-division was permitted only where sub-divided plot was not less than 800 sq. yards. Concession in payment of lease money and ground rent was allowed on same rms and conditions as in G.O. of 1965. Time was extended for payment of first instalment for those who had not received any intimation from Collector by a further period of one month from the date of intimation by the Collector. Clause (c) of the Order is very material as it was decided by government that in all those cases in which offers for grant of fresh leases were made in accordance with existing government orders on the subject and as a result of acceptance thereof by the sitting lessees contract for grant of fresh lease had been legally completed fresh leases were to be sanctioned according to term offered by Competent Authority. And then in March, 1970 an Order was issued by the Government banning grant of renewal of leases all over the State, because the State Legislature was contemplating to bring out legislation on Urban Ceiling. This ban was lifted on 12th January, 1972 but leases hence forth were to be sanctioned by the State Government only. The Commissioner and Collector could make recommendations only. Its clause (i), however, provided that in all those cases where government had sanctioned grant of leases but it could not be executed or registered because of ban imposed in 1970 steps may be taken immediately for its execution. And clause (ii) of the order provided that all those cases in which Collector or Commissioner had approved renewal but it could not be executed because of 1970 order should be sent to government immediately for acceptance. On 9th May, 1972 Urban Building Ceiling Bill was introduced. On 11th July, 1972 Uttar Pradesh Ceiling of Property (Temporary Restriction on Transfer), Ordinance, 1972 (U.P. Ordinance No. XV of 1972) was promulgated in pursuance of Article 398 of the Constitution of India which continued to be extended from time to time till\nUrban Land Ceiling Act, 1976\nwas enacted to prevent concentration of Urban Property and discourage construction of luxurious houses. On 19th December, 1972 the Nazul rules were amended providing for maximum area permissible for renewal of leases of 2000 sq. yards plus land on which building was constructed. Remaining area was to be surrendered to housing board and the lessees were prohibited from sub-dividing or transferring any land. On 10th December, 1976 the Government issued an order superseding all previous orders in respect of renewal of leases of Civil Lines, Allahabad in view of Urban Ceiling Act and laid down fresh terms and conditions for renewal of leases. Various restrictions were put. Lessees were required to submit pro forma to Urban Ceiling Authority. Each case for renewal was to be examined by government. Collector was required to get the bungalows surveyed with help of Development Board. Leases were to be renewed for 1500 sq. metres land in view of\nSections 2\nand\n4\nand Section 4(2) of Urban Ceiling Act. And while doing so all the residents in one house were to be treated as one unit. The rate of premium was fixed at Re. 1/- per sq. feet for residential and Rs. 3/- per sq. feet for commercial purposes. Ground rent was fixed at 0. 25 paisa per sq. feel. This led to representation by the lease-holders' Association to the Minister for Local Self Government requesting for reduction in rate of premium and of ground rent which led the issuance of a fresh government Order on 17th September, 1979. It superseded all previous orders and provided for submission of details about extent and type of construction, utilisation of vacant land etc. Against this order representations were made on 19th Novermber, 1979, 4th December, 1979, 11th July, 1980 and 1st October, 1980 culminating in government order dated 19th April, 1981 which superseded all previous Orders and provided for renewal of leases on fresh and new terms. It provided that leaseholders and their heirs shall be treated as one Unit. They shall file before 30th June, 1981 details about land, its constructed area, its user, time when it was taken on lease etc. List of residents including out-houses dwellers was to be prepared by District Magistrate. Heirs of deceased lease-holders were to be treated, as one unit. Area for which renewal could be made was reduced to building with 500 sq. metre of land appurtenant and 500 sq. metre open land or 1500 sq. metre whichever was more. Area of building for commercial purpose was fixed at 2000 sq. metres. Premium was fixed at 50 paisa per sq. metre.\nCategory of petitioners : --\n4. With order dated April, 19, 1981 the third and last phase came to an end. The second phase namely, between 1966 to 1976 was marked with restrictions on renewal of leases. But from 1976 onwards the shift was different. Area of renewal was reduced from entire to square metre. Unit for premium and ground rent became square feet instead of acre. All heirs of lessees became one unit for renewal. Family was given entirely new meaning. Land covered by outhouses were to be excluded. Lessees could not even opt for it. Thus ended third phase. And lessees approached this Court. Aggrieved persons can be, conveniently, grouped in two broad categories, one to whom notices had been given by Collector and who had complied with terms and conditions as laid down in various orders issued from time to time prior to 1965 and the other to whom no notice was sent and till now have not taken any steps nor there is any order in their favour. Apart from these there are few who had purchased evacuee property from Custodian whose cases shall be dealt with separately. And then there are numerous others who have not approached this Court but may be awaiting outcome of these petitions.\nRight of fresh lease : --\n5. Although, as mentioned, arguments advanced by learned counsel for parties stretched over wide expanse raising issues of law and equity but it is proposed to examine them in the perspective if the lessees had any right in law to get their leases renewed, could they invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or claim being put at par with those whose leases had been renewed either because of\nArticle 14\nor under Administrative law. Was the order dated 19th April, 1981 invalid or its clauses were repugnant being in clash with provisions of Urban Ceiling Act enacted by Parliament; did the lessees who purchased property from evacuee become owners thereof. Taking up the issue if lessees had any right to get fresh lease executed it need not be repeated that the Collector no doubt issued notices in 1958 to the lessees to surrender and leave the land but the government, the lessor, reconsidered the matter in March, 1958 and directed the Collector to grant fresh lease for the entire land in possession of the lessees if they desired to retain it on prevailing market rate of rent and premium. (See supplementary affidavit of State filed in Civil Misc. Writ No, 2293 of 1969 on 4th February, 1986). Whatever doubt remained was dispelled by order dated 23rd April, 1959, a government decision after careful consideration to renew lease of entire area on premium mentioned therein. And this decision never changed. Learned Additional Advocate General urged that leases granted by the Secretary of the State for India were governed by Government Grants Act, 1864.\nTherefore, provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nwere inapplicable. And under\nGovernment Grants Act\n, its nature could be determined by its tenor only. According to him once the time for which leases were granted came to an end it stood determined by efflux of time. And the lessees had no right left in it. Reliance was placed on\nState of Madras v. Osmar Haji and Company\n, AIR 1970 Mad 27. Various terms and conditions of the lease deed filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293 were also placed in support of the submission that lessees had no right left in it, The argument is devoid of any substance because the State, always was and is agreeable to execute fresh leases. Even the learned Addl. Advocate General had to accept that government never adopted shut door policy so far grant of fresh lease was concerned. Apart from it the government by its own conduct stretching over long years has given rise to right in favour of the lessees to get a fresh lease from the State. Since leases were in respect of government land, they were undoubtedly governed by\nGovernment Grants Act\nand their nature could be determined by their tenor. Therefore, after expiry of time for which leases were granted they came to an end. And the government could refuse to grant fresh lease or take over the same. But as seen earlier it did not. Rather it decided to execute fresh leases in favour of every lessee on terms and conditions mentioned in government order. It was said so even in paragraph 3 of the supplementary affidavit filed on 4th February, 1986. In doing so or taking this decision the government was acting in accordance with rules as paragraph 50 of the Manual itself contemplates for renewal or grant of fresh lease after expiry of the lease without any option for renewal. In law where a person, having two alternative courses of actions mutually exclusive chooses to adopt one and rejects the other expressly or impliedly then he is said to have elected to choose one. He is subsequently precluded from adopting the course which he intended to reject. It is known as doctrine of election. Like estoppel it is also child of equity. It is founded on the principle that one should not be permitted to approbate and reprobate that is blow hot and cold in same breath. It has been extended and applied as an aspect of estoppel to prevent a person from falling a victim to what would have otherwise resulted in injustice to him and unfair advantage to other. In Chapter XIII of Estoppel by Representation by Spencer Bower and Turner III Edition page 314, the principle is explained thus :\n\"Where A, dealing with B, is confronted with two alternatives and mutually exclusive courses of action in relation to such dealing, between which he may make his election, and A so conducts himself as reasonably to induce B to believe that he is intending definitely to adopt the one course, and definitely to reject or relinquish the other, and B in such belief alters his position to his detriment, A is precluded, as against B, from afterwards resorting to the course which he has thus deliberately declared his intention of rejecting;\"\nAt page 326 rule of election as applied to relationship is discussed thus,\n \"The most important of these is that of landlord and tenant. In such cases, where the lease or other instrument creating the relation contains provisions for forfeiture or breach of any of the covenants, and a clause of reentry, the lessor, on any breach by the lessee may, if he pleases, put an end to the relationship, but he need not do so, he may prefer not to exercise his right of forfeiture, whether considering it more to his own advantage to take this course or actuated by generosity or other altrustic motive. But if by acts and conduct (which is the normal type of case), or otherwise, he indicates to his tenant an intention to waive the forfeiture, and to treat the tenancy as continuing, he is estopped from subsequently setting up, as against the tenant, that has been forfeited and determined.\".\nThe rule enunciated in this paragraph applies where the landlord waives his right of reentry accrued to him due to breach of the covenant. On principle, however, there does not appear any difference between right of re-entry due to forfeiture or by eflux of time. A lessor may after expiry of period for which lease is granted renew the same or resume that is re-enter. But if out of the two that is reentry or resumption the two divergent courses, he chooses to grant fresh lease or at least creates that impression by his conduct spread over long time it results in abandonment, which according to the Supreme Court in\nSha Mulchand & Co. v. Jawahar Mills\n, AIR 1953 SC 98 is an aggravated form of waiver, he cannot subsequently turn round and claim that he intended to re-enter. Even the terms of lease deed do not support the submission of learned Additional Advocate General. Apart from lease deed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293 of 1981 which was a lease for hotel and building the lease deed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 7226 of 1981 was produced. In material particlars there was no difference. The learned Additional Advocate General also stated that every lease deed even if it was not identical it was similar and terms and conditions of all the leases were almost the same. In these lease deeds there was no express or implied bar for execution of fresh lease. They further did not debar a lessee from applying for fresh lease. Much was attempted to be made out of the following expression,' shall and will at the end of expiration or other sooner determination of the said term peaceably and quietly leave, surrender and yield up to the said Secretary of State..... together with all such erections, buildings, and fixtures'. It was urged that'this indicated that the lessees were to surrender and handover possession peaceably after expiry of the term for which the lease was granted. The expression could not be read in isolation. As is clear it was incorporated as a penal clause to apply where the lessee committed breach of conditions. It was in addition to the right of pulling down unauthorised constructions. Right of re-entry either on expiration of the term for which lease was granted or even earlier was conferred on Collector only if the lessee committed breach of any covenant. The decision in AIR 1974 SC 856 does not appear to have any relevance, since the G.O. of 1959 was not only a hope and expectation but a decision of the government to grant leases to the existing lessees and this policy of the government did not undergo any change at any point of time. The policy in fact remained the same. The government, therefore, having exercised its option and decided to renew leases it is too late in the day for learned Additional Advocate General to urge that granting of lease was only a concession which could be withdrawn by the government at any time. Nor it can be claimed that the principle of election could not apply to government in view of weighty pronouncements by the Supreme Court that government of a constitutional democracy cannot claim immunity from applicability of principles of equity and fairness. The government thus having abondoned its right of re-entry, the learned counsel for petitioner, appears to be right in his submission that it resulted in creating a jural or legal relationship between lessor and lessee permitting them not only to continue in possession but to get a fresh lease executed in their favour. Moreover in a country wedded to ideals of democracy and welfare state it would be unthinkable to import such outdated concept. If the land is needed or building has to be demolished in public interest for general welfare probably no exception can be taken as the interest of individual has to be sacrificed for the society. But asking the lessee to vacate land or remove Malwa for no rhyme or reason but because the State was the owner cannot be accepted to be in consonance with present day philosophy and thinking about role of State.\nRenewal on what terms 1965 or 1981 (i) general :--\n6. Lessees thus being entitled for renewal or grant of fresh leases the next and the most vital issue that calls for adjudication is whether on terms and conditions announed till 1965 or in 1981. Learned Additional Advocate General urged that it was unfair for lessees to claim that their leases should be renewed, for area mentioned in 1959 Order, on premium and rent of 1960 Order and within time extended by 1965 Order. According to him the State having marched ahead towards socialisation it was both unjust and illegal to claim renewal of leases on terms and conditions mentioned in those orders. Talking in terms of socialism, appeared more, as a fashionable expression than with any proportion of realism. Obligation of state to remove inequalities in distribution of wealth, an inherent philosophy of a Welfare State, is not only recognised in civilised society but is an essential attribute of democracy since its concern extends for its people from \"womb to tomb\" Retention of big bungalows with compound of three or four acres in a country with ever growing population is a social sin. Even the Late Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru in his letter dated 25th December, 1959 while writing to the then Minister in U.P. government had pointed out 'the day of large compounds is long past. It would be completely right to take away all the additional lands from them leaving just enough for the house and a little more'. When lease-holder Association represented in 1959 it itself conceded that retention of big compound was against socialistic pattern of society. But in a society committed to rule of law it had to be done within its periphery. Role of State in organising public resources for Community Development and prosperity of the nation cannot be doubted. Nor it can be disputed that optimum for everyone should be modern challenge. Yet it has to be done within four corners of Constitutional framework. And that probably was the reason that State government decided to grant fresh leases for the entire area. Truly speaking renewal or grant of fresh leases had nothing to do with reducing area of the big bungalows. That could be done in acordance with law. It was with this objective that various State Legislatures including our State passed a resolution under Section 252(1) of the Constitution of India which resulted in enactment of\nUrban Land (Ceiling and Regulations) Act, 1976\nby the Parliament for 'preventing concentration of Urban Land in hands of a few persons'. Prior to this there was no law or rule in pursuance of which vacant or excess land of a person could be taken away. And no person after this Act came into force can successfully or validly claim to hold land more than the Ceiling limit. Nor that is claim of petitioners. As mentioed earlier renewal or grant of fresh lease had nothing to do with determination of ceiling limit of a person. Attempt of the learned Additional Advocate General, therefore, to suggest that renewal of entire area was destructive of social or economic balance appears to be hollow claim.\n(ii) Is 1981 order invalid or repugnant to\nArticle 252\nof Constitution.\n7.    It may also be thrashed out at this stage if the order issued by State Government in 1981 is valid, or its various clauses are repugnant to Urban Ceiling Act of 1976.\nIn\nUnion of India v. Valluri Basaviah\n, AIR 1979 SC 1415, the effect of passing the Act was held by Hon'ble Court to be, that 'Parliament which has no power to legislate with respect to the matter which is the subject of the resolution, becomes entitled to legislation with respect to it. On the other hand the\nState Legislature ceases to have a power to\nmake a law relating to that matter'. Therefore,\nthe field of legislation in respect of 'vacant\nland in excess of ceiling limit to be held by a\nperson in Urban agglomeration' became\noccupied. The State Legislature could not\nentrench upon it directly or indirectly. Even\namendment to the Act could be made under\nArticle 252(1)\nby Parliament only. Since the\nState Legislature could not legislate in respect\nof matters covered by the Act the State\nGovernment also could not issue any direction\nor Order or frame a rule which was in violation\nof provisions of the Act as executive power\nof State is co-extensive, under\nArticle 162\nof\nthe Constitution with Legislative power. If\nthe power of the Legislature itself stood\nabrogated then the State Government was\ndebarred from encroaching upon it. Learned\nAdditional Advocate General urged that Slate\nof Andhra Pradesh was one of the States\nwhich had like the State of Uttar Pradesh\npassed a resolution under\nArticle 252(1)\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\nYet it legislated\nand the Legislations were upheld by Full\nBench of that Court in M. Venkatarao v.\nState, AIR 1975 Andh Pra 315 (FB) and T.\nRangayya v. State of A.P.. AIR 1978 Andh\nPra 106 (FB), and the latter decision was\neven affirmed by the Supreme Court. Reliance\nwas placed on paragraphs 1 to 6, 9, 22, 24, 24\nand 40 of 1978 decision and it was urged that\nState law would not be ultra vires but may be\nrepugnant to the extent it clashed with Central\nLegislation. In Andhra Pradesh the Act was\nalready in existence, therefore, it was held\nthat' provisions of it which were in conflict\nwith Central Act were repugnant. But the\nGovernment Order of 1981 was issued unlike\nAndhra Act after the Central Act had\noccupied the field. It is very difficult to agree\nwith the learned Additional Advocate General\nthat even after law has been enacted by\nParliament the State Legislature could enact\na law or government could issue an order in\nrespect of it. Repugnancy and competency\nare not same. After enactment of Central\nAct the State Legislature lost its competency\nto legislate in respect of matter covered by\nlegislation, therefore, after 1976 a government\norder or rule issued in respect of matters\ncovered by Central Act would be invalid.\nFutile attempt was made to suggest that\nentry 18 of List II was couched in wide terms therefore the jurisdiction of State Legislature was not barred in respect of topic not covered by it. It is based on certain observations in\nValluri Basaviah\n's case (supra) forgetting that the Hon'ble Court was concerned with earlier State law, which obviously could not be held to be invalid due to subsequent resolution under\nArticle 252(1)\nexcept that it could not operate after Central enactment to the extent the field was occupied. Nor is there any merit in the submission that\nArticle 252\nof the Constitution being in nature of exception amounting to abdication of surrender of Legislative power of the State it should be given restricted meaning.\nArticles 246\nto 254 carve out Legislative field of Parliament and State Legislature making them supreme in their domain. But in Emergency or where the council of State by 2/3rd Majority or one or more States considered it proper for sake of uniformity to have a Central enactment then it results in transfer of power by one Legislative body to other.\nOnce exercised it is complete, and results in total deprivation of the State's power to legislate upon 'a law made by Parliament' pursuant to the power surrendered to it by the legislature of two or more States holds a very special position under the Constitution and must be held to prevail over any other State law (\nT. Rangayya v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n, AIR 1978 Andh Pra 106 (FB).\n(iii) Are Clauses of 1981 order repugnant to ceiling Act.\n8. Jurisdiction or power of the Legislature and the executive being barred in respect of matters covered by Act XXXIII of 1976 it may be examined if 1981 Order is invalid because it attempts to encroach upon occupied field or assuming as argued by the learned Additional Advocate General even if the order was not void its various clauses being in direct clash with provisions of the entry (entire?) Act were repugnant. The objective of the Act is, 'preventing the concentration of Urban land in hands of a few persons and speculation and profiteering therein and with a view to bringing about an equitable distribution of land in Urban agglomerations to subserve the comon good'. It has been attempted to be achieved by providing that no person shall be entitled to hold any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit', in an Urban agglomeration defined in Clause (n) of Sub-section (2) of the Act. How the ceiling limit has to be determined is provided in\nSection 4\nof the Act. Vacant land of a person defined by sub-clause (i) of clause (a) shall vest in the government under\nSection 10\nof the Act Family has been defined by clause (f) to mean the wife or husband and their minor children. Sub-section (7) of\nSection 4\nprovided for special benefit in respect of a member of Joint Hindu Family. For Allahabad ceiling limit is 1500 sq. metres as it is an Urban agglomeration falling in category 'c' specified in\nSchedule of the Act\n. After this Act was passed the State Government issued first order in December, 1976 keeping in view the Urban Ceiling Act. Even 1979 Order maintained the limit in accordance with Ceiling Act. But when 1981 Order was issued it was reduced to 1500 sq. metre with constructed area. This was indirect attempt to reduce the area of Civil Lines, dwellers to even lower limit than was considered appropriate by Parliament itself to ensure fair distribution of Urban property all over the country. For instance, the constructed area according to supplementary affidavit filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 9094 of 1981 is 3100 sq. yards or 2572 sq. metres. The entire building under Ceiling Act, being dwelling unit, with certain land appurtenant constitutes ceiling limit but under Government order dated 25th April, 1981 even a portion of building shall be required to be demolished. It is clearly an attempt to overreach the Act. It further deprives such persons from right of appeal etc. which otherwise is available to other persons in the Act. It has already been seen that lessees acquired right to get fresh leases executed in their favour in respect of entire land. This could be effected or altered only in accordance with law. Since the government attempted to do indirectly what it could not do directly the clause appears to be bad. Similarly the restriction that all heirs of lessees shall be deemed to be one unit is contrary to the definition in .the Ceiling Act which confines it to the person, his wife and minor sons. Clause which prohibits exercising of option in respect of out-house dwellers irrespective of Ceiling limit etc. is another attempt which is violative of Ceiling Act of 1976. Only other clause in 1981 G.O. is in respect of rate of premium. Charging more money is neither socialistic nor just and fair. Of course, it may adversely affect the economically weak. It was argued by the learned Additional Advocate General that renewal of lease could not be covered in entry 18 of List II. He urged that field occupied by Parliament is in respect of ceiling on vacant land and not renewal of leases of Nazul land. Learned counsel further urged that Explanation to Sub-section (11) of\nSection 4\nof the Act left no room for doubt that provisions of the Act were not applicable to persons holding lease, 'the unexpired period of which was less than ten years at the commencement of the Act', And as term of leases had expired or even where it had not expired its unexpired period was not less than ten years in 1976 the provisions of the Act were inapplicable. The arguments do not appear to have any substance. Subsection (11) of\nSection 4\nis in nature of exception to the clauses mentioned therein. The Explanation to it even if taken as independent section or sub-section is in nature of enabling provision empowering Competent authority to proceed and determine ceiling area if the building was in occupation of tenant treating him as a person 'holding any land'. To suggest that provision of the Act did not apply to lessees would be arguing against legislative policy. Various clauses of the order were thus an indirect attempt to trample on legislating field rendering the entire order bad. In any case, they being repugnant to Act XXXIII of 1976 could not be given effect to. It was over enthusiasm or zeal of those on whose initiative and sincere implementation the successful implementation of Welfare policy rests which resulted in this unfortunate impasse.\niv) Rights under nazul Manual and Govt. order.\n9. Even if the order is not bad or its clauses not repugnant to Ceiling Act it hardly makes any difference in law since the claim of petitioners even otherwise appears to be well founded. Although right of parties have to be decided basically on orders referred to earlier but since arguments had been advanced on Nazul Manual it may be pointed out that none of these orders, in any manner, clash with any paragraph of the Manual. Nazul as described in rule means any land or building which being property of government is not administered as State property; It normally refers to such property which is managed by local authorities that is, Municipal Board or Town Areas etc. Chapter II of the Manual provides in detail how the Nazul property in charge of Municipal Board is to be managed by whom and in what manner. These rules are set of administrative Orders or collections of guidelines issued by government for the authorities to deal with government property. Since no right is claimed by petitioners which does not stem out of it or runs counter to any of the paragraphs it is unnecessary to examine if they have statutory force or are referable to\nArticle 296\nof Constitution of India as argued by the learned Additional Advocate General. Rule 56 of the Manual relating to building leases provides for a minimum period of 90 years. No rule prohibits granting of fresh leases after expiry of this period. Rule 50 of the Manual itself visualises grant of fresh lease or renewal of existing lease which expired without option of renewal as was the case of leases of Civil Lines, Allahabad. Even terms and conditions of lease-deeds did not contain any such restriction. It was vehemently argued by the learned Additional Advocate General that in view of rule 50 no fresh lease could be granted except with approval of State Government That probably was the reason for arguing that provisions in the Manual had the force of law. But the argument appears to be based on misapprehension as the rule applies in those limited cases where grant of lease involves concession in favour of lessees. What is meant by concession has been explained by providing that it should be by fixing the rent at a lower rate than the prevailing market rate. No such material has been brought on record. Even the counter and supplementary affidavits are silent. If it would have been so then government would not have issued G.O. dated 12th January, 1972 directing that all renewal or grant of fresh lease of Nazul land shall be done by State Government only. Therefore, provisions of various government orders being in conformity with the Nazul Manual have to be looked into to decide the right of parties as it now stands firmly established that in absence of any Statute or rule to the contrary executive or administrative instructions have the same force as a rule framed by government and are capable of creating rights and obligations Amarjeet v. State of Punjab, AIR 1975 SC 984. While narrating facts it has been seen that 1959 Order was a government decision to renew the leases. And leases of some persons were renewed as well. In fact the learned counsel for State furnished details of persons who applied for renewal of leases, the date of its expiry, date of notice for renewal, authority by whom renewal was ordered and date of its renewal. From the chart relating to those persons whose lease was renewed, it stands admitted that leases of sixteen persons had been renewed between 1962 to 1967 for the entire area on premium and rent mentioned in 1959 and 1960. Orders either by the Collector or Commissioner. And one   lease was renewed by the State Government in November, 1972 of 2 acres 4752 sq. yards. Basis of renewal or the reason for renewal of leases other than the one renewed in 1972 was disclosed in supplementary counter-affidavit filed by the Nagar Mahapalika in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293 of 1969. It was stated that lease of Dr. K.N. Katju was renewed on 8th January, 1968 as the first instalment of premium for renewal of lease was paid by him on 7th December, 1964. It was further averred in paragraph 4 as far as other persons mentioned in Annexure (P) of the writ petition are concerened, they all have (except Brij Lal Gupta) made payment of at least one instalment of the permium before 3rd December,   1965 the day on which the aforesaid G.O. was issued and accordingly  they were all entitled to renewal of the lease in respect of the land even if it exceeded one acre'. The basis adopted by the government for renewal was payment of at least one instalment of the premium determined by the government by its G.O. dated 23rd April, 1959 amended on 7th July, 1960. But when Civil Misc. Writ No. 7326 was filed in 1981 and the averment in supplementary counter-affidavit filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293 was extracted as admission of government it was resiled and claimed that it was beyond the scope of authority and in any case it being on behalf of Mahapalika it did not bind the government. It is difficult to appreciate this. Nazul land of Civil Lines, Allahabad was and is managed by Nagar Mahapalika, Allahabad. Renewal of leases under management of Local Bodies is no doubt contemplated by Collector, Commissioner of State Government but that surely cannot be reason to disown what was stated on behalf of Mahapalika. Various departments of government and semi government institution are expected to work in unison. Denial or going back on what has been said by one is destructive of harmony and cohesiveness which should be hallmark of working in public departments. The Nagar Mahapalika and State Government in case of Nazul land cannot be treated as different from one another. Statement in the counteraffidavit, therefore, that it did not amount to admission by State Government has to be ignored. Even if the counter-affidavit filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293 is not taken into account on this aspect the government itself admitted in paragraph 51 of the counter-affidavit filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 7326 of 1981. 'The persons in whose favour the lease-deed had been executed had completed all the formalities for grant of fresh lease and that too before the embargo of 1970 came into force. 'It amounts to saying something as was said in counter-affidavit filed in Civil Misc. Writ No. 2293. In paragraph 16 of supplementary affidavit filed on 4th February, 1986 it is admitted that out of 126 persons to whom notices had been issued 116 had paid the premium. But why leases of few only were renewed is not explained. Reason for not renewing leases of few is mentioned which shall be adverted to later. In paragraph 57 of Civil Misc. Writ No. 7236 it is averred that large number of lessees had deposited the requisite premium prior to 1965 and orders for renewal of leases had also been passed but the leases had not been executed. It is not denied in paragraph 52 of the counter-affidavit. No reasons have been disclosed as to what prevented the government from renewing leases of such persons. From the chart supplied by State counsel it is clear that at least forty nine persons to whom notices had been issued by the Collector had applied for renewal and deposited the instalments as well Barring few cases where notice itself was given after 1965 it stands admitted that deposit of first instalment was made before 1965. In some of the cases Commissioner had even passed the Order. Yet the leases were not renewed.\n10.    Avowed      government      policy, therefore, was to renew leases of all 'existing' and 'sitting' lessees if they had deposited at least one instalment after receipt of intimation by Collector. At least that was, to use the language of 1965 Order, to be 'deemed to be proper step on the part of the lessee to get a fresh lease executed by the lessor'. Then there should have been some reason for not adopting same policy for others. Procrastination or delay on part of those who under rules were obliged to pass orders could not recoil on lessees. If something was to be done but it was not done, then in law it shall be assumed to have been done. It was vehemently argued by the learned Additional Advocate General that since renewal could be done by State Government only mere deposit of any instalment by lessees did not create any right in their favour either in law or in equity. In counter-afffidavit also reference has been made to paragraph 50 of the Manual. But the claim is not only devoid of any merit but it is opposed to facts. Undisputedly leases of various persons were renewed by Commissioner and Collector, rather every lease was renewed by these authorities except the one in 1972. How can in teeth of such facts the opposite parties claim that renewal could have been done only by State Government. Even assuming it to be so the renewal could be refused in exercise of discretion on reasonable and just ground. It could not be withheld. Delay in exericse of discretion with passage of time stands converted into duty the non-performance of which becomes enforceable in court of law. Power to do a thing or not to do it is conferred upon public authorities as it was on trust to be exercised validly and properly. It has to be in confine of reasonableness. The inaction of the authorities and delay for long years resulting in injury and causing prejudice to lessee went beyond the ambit of reasonableness. Powers of public authority in democracy governed by rule of law are different than those of private persons. A private person is capable of disposing his property as he likes. The powers are unlimited. But a public authority or a government of Welfare State is committed to act for general welfare and public good. Its ownership is not absolute as that of private person. It holds the property in trust for Welfare of the people who in a democracy are, ultimate sovereign. By nature of ownership, therefore, it has no unfettered or absolute power or discretion. Its actions are to be tested on anvil of public good. And to find out if the action of public authority is for public good it has first to be reasonable and fair. That which is unreasonable or unjust cannot be upheld.\n11. Not only this even in 1965 the government's intentions not to cause any 'hardship' to the lessee is unequivocally expressed in the Order dated 3rd December, 1965 when some further relaxation in terms of renewal was provided. But the most significant is the last sentence of paragraph VIII(b) of the Order extracted below :\n\"It has been also decided that the above principle should be applied in all the cases of existing leases which have expired absolutely and in which the sitting lessees had not deposited, prior to the issue of these orders, one or more instalments of premium and the contract has not become complete between them and the lessor.\"\nIf the Order is read in reverse or affirmatively it hardly leaves any room for doubt that the government intended rather it treated the deposit of at least one instalment before the issue of the Order as creating complete contract between government, and lessee. Since a binding contract came into force by deposit of at least one instalment it could not be eroded unilaterally by change in policy, nor the government could go back on it. It was much after this that renewal of leases was prohibited in March, 1970. But that was also operative only for two years. In January, 1972 when the ban was lifted the government was too keen to renew leases as is clear from the order itself, which directed the authorities to do registration in accordance with law. In all those cases in which government had already approved sanction of leases but the same could not be done because of ban imposed in March, 1970. It further directed that, in those cases in which Collector or Commissioner had approved renewal but it could not be done due to the ban imposed in March, 1970 papers may be immediately forwarded to obtain orders of the government. It is indeed surprising that despite these directions the authorities remained inactive. Even the lease of Sri D.D. Banerji in whose favour government had passed the order in April, 1966 (paragraph 50 of Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 7326 of 1981 which is admitted in paragraph 45 of counter-affidavit), the lease was not registered. After all government orders are passed to be followed by those who are meant to implement it. But it remained in cold storage. If specific government order was not sufficient to move the authorities then it was too much to expect that they would have acted promptly or even belatedly in pursuance of government order of March, 1972 resulting in grave injustice. Fairness in public dealings is core of our jurisprudence. It is a substantive principle the breach or violation of which furnishes cause of action to the aggrieved.\nPromissory Estoppel.\n12. To relieve victim of arbitrary abuse of discretion and pin down public authorities to act with honesty and good faith the Courts have evolved doctrine of Promissory Estoppel In M. P. Sugar Mills v. State of U. P. AIR 1979 SC 621. Its horizon was broadened not only as a weapon of defence but as a cause of action enforceable in a Court of law. It was observed that it was an equitable principle evolved by the Courts for doing justice and there is no reason why it should be given only a limited application by way of defence'. The argument of learned Additional Advocate General that the High Trees case (London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd. (1956) 1 All ER 256 or Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Company (1877) 2 AC 439, which have been source of inspiration for this doctrine by Court in our country confined it to private agreements or contracts and not to government is no more res integra as the doctrine has been applied and extended by our Supreme Court to bind not only Municipal or Local authorities but government as well. The Hon'ble Court in M. P. Sugar Mills case (AIR 1979 SC 621) (supra) after reviewing English and American authorities on this aspect held :\n\"It is indeed the pride of Constitutional democracy and rule of law that the Government stands on the same footing as a private individual so far as the obligation of the law is concerned; the former is equally bound as the latter. It is indeed difficult to see on what principle can a Government, committed to the rule of law, claim immunity from the doctrine of promissory estoppel?\".\nDoubt was expressed on this aspect in\nJit Ram v. State of Haryana\nAIR 1980 SC 1285 : (1981) 1 SCC 11.\nThe principle, however, has been re-affirmed in Union of India v. Godfray Phillips (1985) 4 SCC 369 : (AIR 1986 SC 806).\nIn M. P. Sugar Mills case (supra), it was laid down : \"The true principle of promissory estoppel, therefore, seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties, and this would be so irrespective whether there is any pre-existing relationship between the parties or not.\".\nEvery ingredient of promissory estoppel as explained by Hon'ble Court was undoubtedly present in all those cases in which petitioners had deposited at least one instalment in pursuance of notice or correspondence with Collector. To argue, therefore, that the deposit of instalment by lessees did not create any right in their favour is a cry in vacuum. The learned Additional Advocate General vehemently argued that the claim of petitioners on prevailing practice, sending of draft lease by local authority, demand for premium, sending of plans or deposit of instalments were not sufficient for invoking Promissory Estoppel. He urged that the primary requirement of representation was missing. According to him circumstances which have been mentioned in various petitions could utmost be construed as intention or belief or understanding and not representation by the government so as to create a right in their favour. Reliance was placed on Halsbury Law of England Vol. XVI (Edition IV, 1069 and 1593). Reliance was also placed on Boddeley v. Inland Revenue Commissioner (1953) 2 All ER 233 and National West Minster Bank Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd. (1974) 3 All ER 834, He urged that English decisions which furnished foundation for doctrine of Promissory Estoppel have laid down that there should be fusion of equity with law. In other words, equity must not override law. And the Court should give effect to equity in such a manner that it did not run counter to law and if this principle was applied then it was obvious that while enforcing the rule of equity the Courts could not bye-pass the Nazul manual or government orders issued from time to time in this regard.\nLearned counsel urged that Moti Lal Padampat case (AIR 1979 SC 621), or\nJit Ram\ncase (AIR 1980 SC 1285) or Godfray Phillips, case (AIR 1986 SC 806) (supra) did not create any conflict so far petitioners were concerned. According to him since the law had undergone tremendous change after 1965, it was not possible to enforce something which was contrary to law in 1985 or principle of Promissory Estoppel.\nReliance was placed on paragraph 13 of the Godfray Phillips' case. It was also urged that apart from this the petitioners failed to make out any claim of Promissory Estoppel as the basic ingredient of detriment was not established. In alternative learned counsel urged that even if on the principle of Moti Lal Padampat Sugar Mills case (supra) it was held that \"principle of Promissory Estoppel applied then the assurance extended was to renew the leases it could not be held as assurance in respect of area and premium as well. Reliance was placed on paragraphs 5, 26, 39, 40.\n41 and 50 in\nJit Ram\n's case (supra) and it was urged that because of delay the petitioners had lost their rights in 1965 but in 1985 it was impossible to ask the Court to issue a writ to enforce such a right.\n13. None of the English cases appear to be relevant. In Barclays' (1974-3 All ER 834) theory of implied representation was rejected because it was founded on a forged cheque. According to Webster Third New International Dictionary, 'representation means' statement made to convey a particular view or impression of something with the intention of influencing opinion or action; In Black's Legal dictionary, it is defined as 'Any conduct capable of being turned into a statement of fact'. That the government orders issued from time to time, were statements made to convey that fresh lease shall be granted and therefore it constituted representation to lessees that if they complied with terms and conditions mentioned therein their leases shall be renewed cannot be doubted. Nor it can be disputed that the decision was followed by notices from. Collector informing the lessees that the term of lease had expired and the government was willing to renew the lease if the amount of lease money, site plan etc. was submitted. Even if these notices would not have been there it would not have made any difference as it is admitted that these orders issued by government to Collector were later on made subject of press statement by the Collector. Action in pursuance of these orders followed by deposit of instalment, sanction of plan, sending of draft lease or order by Commissioner could not be construed as belief or faith. To argue that the order of 1959 did not amount to assurance or it could utmost bind the government for renewal but not entire area or an terms mentioned in the Order is ignoring facts. Even the argument of detriment was advanced on misapprehension. In M. P. Sugar Mills case (AIR 1979 SC 621) it was observed, 'that if no detriment was suffered but prejudice would be caused if promisor was permitted to back out then it was sufficient for invoking the equitable principle'. Could there be a better illustration of altering position to prejudice than cases like Misc. Writ Petition No. 6237 of 1982, where the lessees constructed house after depositing the lease money and getting the plans sanctioned. The opposite parties cannot be heard either in law or in equity asserting that the order of Commissioner was without jurisdiction or the term of leases having expired the lessee did not have any right to construct. Such inequitable assertion or claim is prevented from being put forward when right of parties are determined on fairness. Even those cases where the lessees had only deposited the instalment would be squarely covered as they would suffer if the government, the promisor, was permitted to act differently as it is abundantly clear that terms and conditions for renewal in 1981 are not only widely different from what they were in 1959 and 1960 but they seriously prejudice the lessees. Nor is there any merit in submission that representation or assurance was not made by proper authority. The assurance having been extended by State Government through its orders after careful consideration it was by competent authority. Nor did the Commissioner or Collector in acting on it went beyond scope of their authority. In fact all leases which were renewed prior to 1972 were by Commissioner and Collector. Even the Nazul Manual empowered the Commissioner to do so. And above all renewals done by Commissioner and Collector have been accepted in counter-affidavit to be valid and proper renewals. Then in renewing on terms and conditions mentioned in Government Order the Commissioner or Collector did not act contrary to law.\n14. Subsequent change of policy could stand in way of petitioners only if no right was created in their favour. But as observed earlier the petitioners having deposited instalments as announced or envisaged in government orders right stood created in their favour. If the wheel of law had already completed its course then it could not be turned round because there was a shift in policy. Such claim was rejected in M. P. Sugar Mills' case (AIR 1979 SC 621) (supra). It was observed :\n\"Mere claim of change of policy would not be sufficient to exonerate the government from the liability, the government would have to show what precisely is the changed policy its reason and justification so the Court can judge for itself which way the public interest lies\".\nChange in policy by government was attempted to be defended due to enactment of Celling Act, of 1976. How could this result in nullifying the implied contract which had come into force by deposit of first instalment or alter the right created in favour of lessees on assurance extended by government is not easy to comprehend. No one can deny that after enactment of Ceiling law a lessee cannot hold land more than the limit provided therein. But what it had to do with renewal or grant of fresh lease. Why was it necessary to supersede the government order. Grant of fresh lease could be subject to law. No one can claim nor it has been claimed that by renewal of leases the lessees shall not be subject to ceiling law. The government itself treated renewal or grant of fresh lease differently from alienation. It issued a government order in 1970 prohibiting any transfer and banning all renewal of leases. By order issued in 1973 alienation was permitted subject to permission by Collector. And as mentioned earlier renewals of Nazul leases were permitted from 1972 without any restriction on area. Therefore, despite Ceiling Act being in offing and draft model bill pending before Parliament having been circulated on 22nd March, 1972 to renew leases, it directed the District Magistrate and Commissioner to take immediate steps for renewal. That there was no intention or policy to curtail the area is further clear from the renewal of one lease in December, 1972, for more than one acre. The argument, therefore, that there was a change in policy has no legs to stand. As observed by Hon'ble Court in M. P. Sugar Mills case (AIR 1979 SC 621) (supra) the change in policy could not be a pretext. It had to be justified. It had to be co-related with public interest or compelling necessity. Nothing has been mentioned in the government Order of 1981 or any order issued prior to it nor any consideration by government resulting in change of policy has been averred in the counter-affidavit which could establish that government was compelled to depart from its declaration to renew leases on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959 and 1960 Orders which was reiterated in every subsequent Order till 1976. If till 1976 the government policy was to renew on terms of 1959 and 1960 then it was for government to show that there were circumstance which justified its reversal Over enthusiasm or misplaced zeal of administration in absence of public interest frustrates State activity. Reliance on paragraph 13 of Godfray Philips' case (AIR 1986 SC 806) (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Court pointed out the circumstances in which, 'the doctrine of Promissory estoppel would be displaced', also does not appear to be appropriate. No estoppel is being pleaded against Legislative function nor the government is being asked to enforce what is statutorily prohibited. Nor was the assurance or promise to renew the lease for entire area on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959 and 1960 Order was contrary to any law. Even now there is no law which shall be violated. As observed earlier the renewal is bound to be subject to Ceiling law, therefore, it could not be contrary to law.\nIn\nGujarat State Financial Corporation v. Lotus Hotels Pvt. Ltd.\nAIR 1983 SC 848, the Hon'ble Court extended the principle of Promissory estoppel to compel performance of duty which was causing harm and injury due to unreasonable conduct of the corporation.\nIn Suraya Narain v. Bihar State Electricity Board AIR 1985 SC 941 the government was held bound by its declaration to absorb the Engineers recruited by it earlier. Basis for all these decisions is fairness and bona fide. As regards R. K. Deka v. Union of India AIR 1984 Delhi 413, it does not help opposite parties as deposit in that case was made in pursuance of voluntary scheme announced by government and not under any Government Order as in this case, Executive necessity may inhere power of variation but in cases of petitioner it was just the otherwise. The petitioner had right to get the leases executed on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959 and 1960 Order. This was not rendered impossible or against public policy.\nArticle 14\nof Constitution of India.\n15. Thus petitioners who had deposited at least one instalment prior to 1965 or in intimation by Collector had right to get fresh lease not only under government order and Nazul Manual but also because the government could not back out from the assurance extended by it. Apart from the equitable principle of estoppel the thrust of submissions have been that all those lessees who had complied with terms of government, Order and even those to whom no notice was given by Collector were entitled to be put at par with those whose leases had been renewed because, 'equals are entitled to equal things'. To appreciate this it is necessary to mention that those persons whose leases had been renewed were eminent and had acquired social status or political stature. For instance, late Dr. K. N. Katju, ex-Central Law Minister, Chief Minister and Governor, Sri S. K. Verma, ex-Chief Justice and Governor, late Sri B. L. Gupta, ex-Judge of this Court, Sri J. D. Shukla, I. C. S. renowned civil servant, Sri O. N. Misra, I. A. S. well known bureaucrat, late Sri Bal Mukand Bagga, wealthy businessman. But out of those who were left out of the galaxy is no less distinguished. To name few, Sri S. N. Kacker, ex-Central Law Minister, Solicitor General of India and Advocate General of the State, late Sri S. S. Dhavan, ex-Judge of this court, Governor, and High Commissioner, late M. L. Chaturvedi, ex-Judge of this Court and member of Union Public Service Commission, Sri W. Broome, I. C. S. and Sri R. L. Gulati, Sri Hamid Hussain, late Sri Bhagwan Das Gupta, all ex-Judges of this Court, Sri Lal Ratnakar Singh I. A. S. Ex-Member of Board of Revenue and member of the Committee constituted in Clause (2) of 1959 Order along with Sri O. N. Misra whose lease had been renewed. Lessees in Civil Lines Allahabad constituted one class.\nSome might have succeeded in their life but that surely could not take them out of the class and entitle the government to treat them differently. Political strength or executive height, economic affluence or social stature could not justify favourable treatment. It cannot be accepted as reasonable basis for picking and choosing out persons similarly situated for different treatment. Even where no uniformity is discernible. For instance, lease of portion of plot No. EE/B was renewed to enable Sri P. D. Tandon (an eminent journalist and ex-Minister) to purchase it. Other portion in occupation of Sri S. N. Kacker remained where it was even though all formalities had been completed. Both Sri S. N. Kackar, and Sri P. D. Tandon came of rich and influential background. Both succeeded ia their life and attained social and political stature. And yet they were not treated similarly what impelled the authorities to renew leases of some and refuse others cannot be easily made out. Various counter and supplementary affidavits filed on behalf of opposite parties are silent and have left it for speculation and guessing. In respect of renewal or grant of fresh leases every lessee stood in the same class or group as those whose leases had been renewed, because a class is known or described by its characteristics, quality or trait or relation or combination of these. In supplementary affidavit fifed in November, 1985 on behalf of State in Writ Petition No. 2269 of 1969 it was stated that fresh lease was granted in favour of Sri S. K. Verma, in 1972 because 'he had applied for the grant of fresh lease or renewal of the lease on 10th May, 1958 before the issue of G. O. dated 23rd March, 1959. Action had been started in his case before the issue of G. O. although the premium was ultimately paid on 27th May, 1972, whereafter fresh lease was granted. His case was thus distinguishable with other cases'. It was further pointed out that 'negotiations were going on between State government and Sri S. K. Verma, about the purchase of his property at Ghazipur and for the adjustment of the premium from the sale proceeds of the said house. However, the deal could not be materialised. It was due to negotiations that the payment of lease money continued to be deferred'. To say the least there could have been no better lame excuse than what has been offered in this affidavit. Applying for grant of fresh lease before issue of G. O. dated 23-3-1959 could not create a different class for Sri Verma from others who had made similar applications either before 1959 or after 1959. 'Mini classifications based on micro-distinctions are false to our equalitarian faith and only substantial and straightforward classification plainly promoting relevant goals can have constitutional validity. To over do classification is to undo equality, State of J. & K. v. T. N. Khosla AIR 1974 SC 1. Equal protection of laws or equal treatment under government orders or executive instructions to persons similarly situated cannot be denied on assumed difference or artificial groupings. The government cannot be permitted to say that it will give jobs or enter into contracts or issue quotas or licence only in favour of those having grey hairs or belonging to a particular political party 6r professing a particular religion or faith', Ramanna v. I. A. Authority of India AIR 1979 SC 1628. To secure the ideal of equality, render it workable and effective the law may classify and may determine range of persons who may be treated similarly or differently, but the classification, (i) must be founded on intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the objective sought to be achieved by the Statute in question. The classification may be founded on different basis namely, geographical or according to the object or occupation or the like.\nWhat is necessary is there must be a nexus between the basis of classification or the object of the Act under consideration :\nBudhan Choudhry v. State of Bihar\nAIR 1955 SC 191. As seen earlier, the opposite parties have failed to disclose any reason for differentiating or picking up some for grant of fresh lease and denying it to others. The action of the authorities, therefore, was violatlve of the basic requirement of classification being based on intelligible differentia distinguishing one person from the other. Constitutional pledge of equality is founded on ethical principle of equal opportunity and similar treatment to persons similarly situated. It ensures fairness, instils descipline and promotes rule of law the very basis and foundation of Welfare State which ensures protection of individual against arbitrary exercise of power by the public authority. 'Do not discriminate without reason', should not only be the endeavour but definite and positive approach.\n16.\nIn\nE. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu\nAIR 1974 SC 555, the Supreme Court laid bare new dimensions of\nArticle 14\nby expanding its scope and extending its guarantee against arbitrariness. Equality was described as a 'dynamic concept which could not be 'cribbed, cabined, and confined\", within the traditional and doctrinaire limits. The Hon'ble Court observed that' from a positivistic point of view equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies. One belonged to the rule of law in a republic, while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute Monarch'.\nIt was further widened in Ramanna's case (AIR 1979 SC 1628) (supra), when the Hon'ble Court held,' that\nArticle 14\nstrikes at arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality'. Even the learned Additional Advocate General could not defend, what could not be defended. He, however, emphasised the word 'deny' in\nArticle 14\nwhich means refuse, reject, repudiate or decline and urged that to establish discrimination under\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution it was necessary for the petitioners to establish continuous denial According to him although petitioners might have been equally placed with those whose leases had been renewed but they were distanced in time. Learned counsel submitted that by passage of time it became impossible for government to renew the leases and the petitioners cannot seek protection of\nArticle 14.\nLearned counsel urged that being treated less favourably than others which is the source of petitioners claim could not be\" covered in ambit of\nArticle 14.\nLearned counsel submitted even if there was any discrimination it could not benefit petitioners and if the government for some reasons committed any error in picking out some persons and confer benefit on them then others who were left out cannot derive any advantage as action of the government qua those persons may be bad but this cannot be a ground for granting fresh lease to petitioners. The submission proceeds on complete misapprehension of\nArticle 14.\nThe content and reach of which cannot be put in strait-jacket. It is an expanding and developing philosophy. It is not an abstract formula but a concept to bring equality in a society based on unequals. It protects undue favour to one and (illegible) to others,. It cuts at arbitrariness. Various government orders issued from time to time were declarations of public policy which could not be bargained. Omission on part of government or its functionaries not to pass an order resulting in hardship and injustice is as bad as an order passed arbitrarily without application of mind. The latter results in removal of the order from record whereas former attracts direction to act in accordance with law. The State Government by delaying matters for no reason created a situation where its actions became discriminatory and violative of\nArticle 14.\nIn\nSri Chand v. Government of U. P.\n, AIR 1986 SC 242, discrimination was held to have arisen between operators who were plying because of orders of High Court and others due to unreasonable delay on part of government in approving the Scheme. The explanation given by learned Additional Advocate General during arguments that as leases of nearly 200 persons were involved which required examination of various documents and circumstances without there being any such averments in any counter or supplementary affidavits was a futile attempt to cover up which was incapable of being protected. It was handsome apology for atrocious inaction. By these petitions relief sought is not for striking down the renewal of leases in favour of certain persons but for a direction to government to treat them in similar manner as they had treated others. The entire code of our jurisprudence is founded on honesty in approach and fairness in behaviour. A government of a Welfare State cannot and should not try to wriggle out of what has been done by it by adopting subterfuges. If the government was persuaded for some reasons extraneous or otherwise to enforce its orders in favour of some of them it cannot deny similar treatment to others similarly situated only because they did not have necessary resourcefulness to approach the government. Bu a case where discrimination had arisen due to governmental action it shall be deemed that those who have been denied the benefit were also entitled to same relief on assumption that they had approached the government and the government should have granted the same benefit as it granted to others.\nDecision in\nChief Commr. v. Kitty Puri\nAIR 1973 Delhi 148, that favour shown by government to some similarly situated cannot furnish cause of action to others to approach the Court for similar treatment became doubtful in view of Sangara Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1984 SC 1499, where the Hon'ble Court directed the petitioner to be put in same bracket' by reinstating him as others who had been favoured by government were similarly situated. It was held by the Hon'ble Court, 'logically the appellants must receive the same benefit which those reinstated received in the absence of any distinguishing feature in their case'.\nRatio in\nNarain Das v. Improvement Trust\nAIR 1972 SC 865, also is not helpful to opposite parties as the Hon'ble Court refused to grant any relief to petitioner not because he was not entitled to be treated similarly with others who had 'erroneously succeeded in getting his land exempted', but because petitioners failed, to bring their case 'within\nSection 56\nof the Act'.\nIn\nRandhir Singh v. State of Punjab\nAIR 3977 SC 2209, it was held that one should not be subjected to unjustified treatment. And 'to remedy the unjust,' the Hon'ble Court directed that the petitioner should be placed on par with others.\nIn Vishnu Das Hindu Mill v. State of M. P. AIR 1981 SC 1636, the claim that accidental or unconscious discrimination cannot furnish ground for any action in Court of law was rejected.\nEffect of failure of Collector to give Notice to the lessees.\n17. It may now be seen if those lessees to whom no notice had been given by Collector can claim violation of any right and if they also are justified in asserting that they should be put at par with those to whom notices were issued. It may not be out of place to mention that in the very first order issued on 23rd April, 1959 it was mentioned that the leases should be renewed if applications for renewal were put in within a reasonable time'. Clauses 2 and 3 of the G. O. provided for assessment of actual rent and premium which was to be 'intimated to the lessee' obviously to enable him to know the amount which he was required to deposit. Issuing of notice was reiterated even in 1965 G. O. Clause 6 made it necessary for the lessee to pay at least one instalment of premium 'at the rates now decided' within one month of the receipt of intimation by him from the Collector. It is thus obvious that it was not only the intention but clear and declared policy of the government that premium etc. should be deposited on receipt of notice by Collector, and that was proper and reasonable as well as it required determination in each case about the area for which the lease Was to be renewed, the premium which was required to be paid. By issuing notice to some and denying to others the Collector created two class of persons without any basis. Since the performance of the order was dependent on notice to be issued by Collector, the action of the Collector in omitting to issue notice to some was obviously discriminatory. As entire movement of grant of fresh lease was dependent on notice which cannot be construed in any other manner except that it was mandatory then non-issuance of it resulted in breach and no shelter could be sought by the opposite parties that petitioner should have approached by themselves. It was for this reason that Supreme Court in Hindu Mall's case (AIR 1981 SC 1636) (supra) held that discrimination perpetuated even by oversight was vicious. From government orders issued from 1959 to 1965 it is clear that the decision of the government to renew grant of fresh leases for entire area was clear and unequivocal. Negotiations between the government and the lease holders association was only in respect of premium and rent. Even various clauses of 1965 order do not show that negotiations were at an end. In Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Company (1877) 2 AC 439 (1874-80), All ER (Rep), 187 it was held that if time was spent in negotiations then it should be deemed on principle of equity that time granted by the notice for doing an act stood waived. At page 197 Lord Black Burn quoted judgment of Mellish LL.J' notwithstanding the fact that although he himself intended to abandon his six months notice yet in my judgment if his conduct was such as to put the defendant on their guard and to leave them reasonably to believe that strict legal right of the six months notice should not be insisted upon that is individual to entitle to relief upon equitable ground'. In Birmingham and District Land Co. v. London and North Western Railway Co. (1888) 40 Ch D 268) ; (1886 to 1890), All ER (Rep) 620, the principle was reiterated that if the course of negotiation had the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict right arising under the contract will not be enforced and be kept in abeyance, then it should not be permitted to be enforced so as to work inequitably.\nIn\nRandhir Singhs\n' case (AIR 1977 SC 2209) (supra) the petitioner was put at par by directing the authorities to grant him similar treatment as to others even though he approached after expiry of date. The Hon'ble Court repelled claim of Medical authorities, that the letter sent to petitioner on corresponding address having returned he could not base his claim on late delivery of telegram on village address, on principle of fairplay and anxiety to prevent injustice to the candidate who was not to blame :\nOn same principle the lessors who were prevented from depositing first instalment because no notice was sent by Collector cannot be subjected to unjustified treatment which results in disadvantage to them and advantage to others of the same class. In fact discrimination arose because of action of Collector in not issuing notices to all lessees.\nIndividual and Illustrative cases :\n18. Even though principle of law discussed earlier applies to all petitions yet some of the petitions have peculiar features and also because in respect of some State has disclosed reasons for not renewing the leases in supplementary affidavits filed on 4th February, 1986 it is appropriate to examine them separately. Civil Misc. Writ No. 7226 of 1981 :\nEvacuee Property\n19. House No. 11, Edmonston Road, Allahabad belonged to Sir Shah Mohd. Sulaiman, an ex-Chief Justice of this Court. Some of his heirs, on partition of the country migrated to Pakistan. Consequently they became evacuee under clause (d) of\nSection 1\nof Administration of Evacuee Property Act and their right and interest become 'evacuee property within meaning of Clause (f) read with Clause (j) of\nSection 1\n. And the property vested in the Custodian In 1954 Lady Fatima, wife of the Chief Justice claiming to be co-sharer but not being an evacuee appears to have filed a 'claim' within meaning of clause (b) of\nEvacuee Interest Separation Act, 1951\nwhich was decided by competent Officer in Cases Nos. 397 and 411 of 1954 and share of the lady was separated from 'composite property' defined in clause (d) of Section 2 of Separation Act. On separation the evacuee interest vested in the Custodian. On 17th September, 1956, entire property was sold by competent officer under power conferred upon him upon\nSection 10\nof Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1951 in favour of late Tika Ram Gulati, father of petitioner, who had migrated from Pakistan to Allahabad in 1947 after partition. Sale certificate under rule 11E was issued in his favour on 2nd April, 1957. Payment was made by adjusting the amount of compensation which late Gulati was to get under Payment of Claims Act for the immoveable property left by him in Pakistan.   According   to   averments   in paragraph 11 of the petition when property was sold it was announced by the competent Officer that the term of the lease which was to expire in 1964 was to be automatically renewed for a period of 25 years from the date of expiry of the lease without any further change except the ground rent which was to be Rs. 60/- per year. On September 2, 1967 the   petitioner   wrote   a   letter   to   the Administrator, Nagar Mahapalika, Allahabad , informing him that he had come to know that the lease of the site had expired but it has not been    automatically    extended    as   was announced at the time of auction nor any notice had been received by him. Since the petitioner was anxious to get the lease renewed the letter may be treated as a request for the renewal of the lease. In pursuance of this letter he was required to furnish some information which was done by him. But he was informed that the leases were not being renewed for more than one acre. In July, 1973 the petitioner sent representation to the local Self Government for renewal of the lease of the entire land separately to every co-owner.  It was stated that since sale consideration was Rs. 73,0007- late Sri Gulati with permission of the authorities associated one M. L. Suri, who also was an evacuee as co-purchaser. Later on petitioner purchased share of Suri, and became co-owner with his father. And after his father's death he in his own right and his other brother by devolution became co-owners. The letter was forwarded to the Commissioner, Allahabad who in turn forwarded it to Nagar Mahapalika which agreed with petitioner that his case was different from others and he and his co-owners were entitled for renewal of the entire area by splitting the land. The respondent the Mahapalika was endorsed by Collector and Commissioner as well. Since despite these orders the lease was not renewed, the petitioner addressed a letter to the Chief Minister on 10th July, 1975 which was sent to the Minister, Local Self Government who acknowledged the letter and asked the petitioner to meet him at Lucknow. In paragraph 22 of the writ petition it is staged that petitioner met the Minister concerned, who assured him that necessary action would be taken soon. In counter-affidavit these factual averments are not disputed. It is stated that after expiry of the lease on 28th Sept. 1964 notice was issued to the ex-lessee on 3rd February, 1965 to surrender the land or to apply for fresh lease.\n20. Issue of notice in 1964 to ex-lessees because their name was recorded in records when property had been sold by competent officer in 1956 and permission had been granted by opposite parties for transfer of share of M. L. Suri, co-purchaser with late Tika Ram Gulati, to petitioner do not reflect well on working in the office of opposite parties. It was as bad as giving no notice. And then what about petitioners letter sent in 1965 and then recommendation of Nagar Mahapalika, etc., in his favour. No attempt was made to rectify the error. The pttitioner, therefore, is entitled to be treated similarly as other. Since petitioner was prevented from complying with orders because of failure of opposite parties to give him notice, therefore, it could not result in forfeiture of his lease rights nor could the opposite parties exercise option of re-entry.\n21. Necessity of examining this petition, separately, arose not because no notice was served but because it was urged that as a result of sale of evacuee property after bringing it in compensation pool under the\nDisplaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954\nthe petitioner became owner of it. It was argued that all property vested in her or his Majesty before the independance. But it was managed by Secretary of State for India. According to learned counsel this right comprised in itself the right of ownership and the subordinate right, that is, the lessee's right. He urged that ownership continued with her Majesty but lessees rights were transferred. According to him the ownership and the lessees rights were two different rights and they vested in two different persons. And when country became independent and the property became evacuee by virtue of\nAdministration of Evacuee Property Act\nand it vested in the custodian then it was vesting of lessees rights in a person who till then was the owner. Learned counsel submitted that it was the obligation of the British government which devolved on India and it became recognised as persons who came from Pakistan became Indian Nationals and vice versa. He urged that by operation of\nEvacuee Property Act\nthere was a surrender of lessee's right resulting in merger. Reliance was placed on\nSection 111(d)\nof the Transfer of Property Act. According to him lesser right of the lessee stood annihilated and nothing was left in evacuee property as the bigger State namely, the lessor's interest or the ownership interest annihilated or devoured the lesser interest, that is, lessee's interest. In other words it became the property of government. It was such property which was brought into compensation pool under the Displaced.\nPersons Act\nand was converted into cash for compensating the persons who had been displaced. To do this or to convert the property into money, the government sold the property. Therefore, the effect of it was that what was transferred in favour of purchaser was not right, interest or title but property itself. He urged that it was erroneous to argue that it was interest of evacuee which was transferred. According to him what was transferred was the property as was clear from Annexure II to the rejoinder Affidavit. Learned counsel urged that by operation of law the lease in favour of the evacuee stood determined. Learned counsel urged that under the\nSettlement of Evacuee Property Act, 1951\nread with the\nDisplaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954\nthree interests were created, one of the evacuee, the other of the government and the third of those who had gone to Pakistan. These three interests could be adjusted by separating interest of evacuee with those who had stayed in the country. Learned counsel submitted that if this be correct then in the house in dispute there was the interest of heirs of Sir Sulaiman, who had gone to Pakistan his widow who had stayed in this country and the government. Learned counsel urged that it was a composite property within the meaning of\nSection 2(c)\nand (d) of the\nAct and The Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954\nand since\nSection 3\nhad overriding effect on all inconsistent law including law relating to Evacuee Property it was the provision of Displaced Persons Act which was to prevail. Learned counsel urged that it was not disputed nor it could be disputed that custodian must have informed the competent Officer and he must have proceeded to sell the property in accordance with law.\nAccording to him factually the competent Officer did proceed in accordance with law as was clear from the averments made in paragraph 4 of the writ petition which were not denied. Learned counsel urged that from Annexure (2) to the Rejoinder Affidavit namely, Sale certificate, it was clear that the interest was separated and the effect of separation on the right of government was that the whole property or the entire property vested in the government without encumbrance. Therefore, theoretically the government Under\nSection 12\nof 1954 Act acquired its own property and then when it transferred the property in favour of petitioner it was transfer of not only the right and interest but the property ifself. Reliance was placed on\nMohd. Fasiuddin Khan v. Government of India\nAIR 1976 SC 361 and Haji Siddik and Haji Umar v. Union of India\nAIR 1983 SC 259.\n22. Effect of acquiring property Under Section 12 of Displaced Persons Act of 1954 by publishing a notifications, as was done in\nFassiuddin\n's case (supra), and bring it in compensation pool may result in vesting of the property in Central Government free from all encumbrance and its transfer in lieu of compensation may result in creating absolute interest to that extent in transferee. Even it may be assumed that transfer of perperty under 1954 Act is by converting it into cash, therefore, if any part of it is taken away it may amount to deprivation or reduction of the compensation which may be contrary to law. But all this appears to be academic as no foundation has been laid in the petition nor any material has been brought on record to establish that property was acquired Under\nSection 12\nand it formed part of compensation pool. It was only after acquisition Under Section 12 of Displaced Persons Act that custodian could cease to have jurisdiction and the property could be dealt under 1954 Act.\nBut since there was no acquisition consequences of 1954 Act could not follow (See\nBasant Ram v. Union of India\nAIR 1962 SC 994 and Gopal Singh v. Custodian AIR 1961 SC 1320). Even in the amendment application filed on behalf of petitioner no such averment had been made. No inference can be drawn about these only because sale certificate was issued in favour of petitioners father. Then it was a sale by competent Officer under\nEvacuee Separation Act, 1951\nand not under\nSection 14\nof Displaced Persons Act, 1954. Evacuee interest could be sold by Custodian or it could be acquired by Central Government\nu/s 12\nof Displaced Persons Act, 1954. It is in a latter class, that is acquisition only that provisions of 1954 Act apply. Suggestion that since sale certificate was granted by competent Officer who is referable to\nSection 16(2)(b)\nof D. P.& C. R. Act, 1954, therefore, it should be assumed that property formed part of compensation pool cannot be accepted. Nor any assistance can be derived only because sale certificate was not issued in Form No. XXIII meant for lease hold rights.\n23. Nor there appears any merit in the submission that there was a merger of lessor's and lessee's interest, either because of\nAdministration Evacuee Property Act\nor under\nSection 111(d)\nof Transfer of Property Act. Even assuming that\nTransfer of Property Act\napplied Section 111(d) could operate only if lessor and lessee's interest vested in the same person. But the property admittedly belong to State Government whereas the evacuee interest which included lessee's interest vested in the Central Government. Division of property into property of Dominion and State is recognised by\nArticle 294\nof the Constitution of India. Under Government of India Act, 1858 the entire property of company vested in Her Majesty\nu/s 39\n. It continued under\nSection 28\nof Government of India Act, 1915 but under\nSection 72\nof Government of India Act, 1935 the property vested in Her Majesty for Government of India or province. The same scheme continued under' the Indian Independence (Rights) Property and Liability Order, 1947 except that property vested now in Governor General. Theref6re, Central and State governments were two different persons in whom different interest vested. As regards Central Government what vested in Custodian its representative was 'property' of an evacuee. That is whatever interest the evacuee had and since the evacuee had lessee's interest only this was capable of vesting in Custodian. Further by vesting of properly in custodian, who as the word itself indicates had only the custody of property nature of property could not change and it continued to be property of evacuee, therefore when sale was made it could be of evacuee interest oniy (See Mohd. Ali v. Bhagirath, 1964 Andh Pra 126, and Mohd. Ebrohim v. Essak Haji Ali Mohammad, AIR 1962 Bom 169). Apart from it, it cannot be disputed that whole property did not become evacuee property as interest of widow of Sri Sulaiman was separated.\nTherefore, what vested in the custodian was the interest in the house of heirs of late Sri Sulaiman, who had migrated to Pakistan, minus the interest of his widow as is clear from\nPirdhandas Parsumal v. Hajrabai Mohd.\n(1968) 9 Guj LR 24 But what was sold to petitioner was the entire bungalow that is the interest of evacuee and non evacuee. Thus the claim of petitioner that his father became absolute owner stands negatived. But the petitioner had automatic right of renewal of lease for 25 years. Allegation in paragraph 11 of the Writ Petition remains uncontroverted. And that probably was responsible for such a fabulous price for a building the lease of which was going to expire just in seven years. Since lessee's interest vested in custodian who transferred it to petitioner's father on explicit condition of automatic renewal for 25 years it shall be deemed as one of the conditions stood added to lease. The opposite parties, therefore, were bound to renew lease of petitioner for 25 years automatically without charging any premium from them. Since in other respects petitioner's case is similar to others fresh lease shall be executed in his favour but no premium shall be charged for first 25 years.\nCivil Misc. Writ No. 9573 of 1981 :\nUnfair Stand of Opposite Parties.\n24. Evacuee interests in Site No. 30, Civil Lines, Allahabad were sold to Lala Karoli Mal on 6th July, 1959 who sold it to petitioners on 6th March, 1962 after obtaining permission from Collector, Allahabad on 13th February, 1962. Although all this was admitted in counter-affidavit but in supplementary affidavit filed on 4th February, 1986 a legal issue has been raised that since purchase was made after expiry of lease it could not create any interest in favour of petitioner. Needless to emphasis that such unfair stand does not behove the government. Granting of permission by Collector was not only giving up right of re-entry but recognition of subsisting interest of lessee.\nCivil Misc. Writ No. 11349 of 1981 :\n25. It is claimed that since Mrs. J. D. Patel and Mrs. F. Chinnimi became Pakistani nationals no subsisting right was left in petitioner. Premises No. 24 Canninghton Road, belonged to one Sri C. D. Mostishan. He died leaving a Will dated llth March, 1922 in favour of Mrs. B. B. Mistry, his adopted mother and her heirs. Suit No. 24 of 1940 was filed by step brother of Sri Mohisan challenging the will It was held invalid by Supreme Court on 9th May, 1956 qua Mrs. Mistry but valid qua her presumptive heirs namely, Mrs. Patel and F. Chinnimi. To describe them as ex-lessees in the circumstances is not correct. They did not go to Pakistan as a result of partition. Further Collector having given notice for grant of fresh lease in 1963 all this appears to have been raised mere for arguments' sake.\nCivil Misc.  Writ Nos. 2293/69.  7001/81, 7133/81, 11349/81, 7228/81 and 12596/84 :\nJoint Residential arid Commercial\n26. Premises are used both for residential and commercial purposes. How such leases are to be renewed in mentioned in detail in clause III of 1965 Order. In view of these guidelines where commercial purpose is nominal or in corner or in a small portion such as Civil Misc. Writ No. 7001/81 or 7133/81, then the authorities may determine premium at an early date treating it as residential.\nCivil Misc. Writ No. 7326 of 1981 :\nIllustration of Promissory Estoppel\n27. Site No. EE, Civil Station was purchased by petitioner on 24th May, 1954. Fresh lease deed was executed on 22nd May, 1956. Term of the lease expired on 5th January, 1959. On 25th August, 1959 Executive Officer, Municipal Board sent notice informing that since no application for renewal had been (made) in pursuance of press note it may be presumed that lessee was not interested in fresh lease. Notice was replied on 29th August, 1959 expressing interest in renewal. Request was made for treating letter as formal application for renewal. Printed notice was given on 14th December, 1959. Notice dated 2nd November, 1960 giving premium and rent. On 13th January, 1961, facility of payment by instalments granted. First instalment paid on 30th October, 1959. Collector forwarded the cheque on 15th November, 1962 for action for execution of lease. On 4th January, 1963 Municipal Board sent three copies of site plan for new lease. Plan was returned duly signed on 10th January, 1963. Demand of original lease by Municipal authorities could not be complied. Last instalment deposited on 22nd January, 1967. In 1965 Municipal authorities sanctioned demolition of existing bungalow and fresh construction. New bungalow constructed on huge cost It is a classic instance of Promissory Estoppel-\nCivil Misc. Writ No. 8171 of 1981 :\nIllustration of\nArticle 14 :\n28. Lease of site C of 30, Elgin Road, expired on 13th March, 1961. Notice dated 26th December, 1961 by Collector to petitioner either to surrender or apply for fresh lease. Co-lessees applied on 29th January, 1962. On 19th June, 1962 Collector sent pro forma to deposit a sum of Rs. 23,325-63 p. and Rs. 294.88 p ground rent and on 19th October, 1962 permitted petitioner to deposit in five instalments. First instalment deposited on 17th November, 1963 and last on 8th February, 1966. Copies of site plan duly signed by co-lessee returned or; 10th March, 1966 and D. D. letter by Superintendent, Nazul properties intimating that Commissioner had sanctioned fresh lease. On 26th January, Nagar Mahapalika took possession of 77 sq. yards for widening road. Consequently refunded Rs. 190/-. Despite letter in 1973 and notice in 1977 to State Government no lease granted when fresh lease was executed in favour of Sri S. K. Verma, while he was acting Governor, in respect of site situated within ten yards distance of site 'C'. Both petitioner and Sri Verma have been judges of this Court. Houses of both are adjacent No distinguishing feature. Apart from promissory estoppel glaring case of discrimination.\nCivil Misc. Writ No. 9094 of 1981\n29. Although petitioner deposited the amount demanded by opposite parties, but he had applied for renewal of entire. In any case no estoppel against legal rights.\nCivil   Misc.   Writ   No. 8941/81,  8949/81, 9178/81, 9569/81 and 11932/81\n30. These referred in supplementary affidavit do not call for any separate discussion.\n31. That takes us to the last submission advanced by the learned Additional Advocate General, namely if this Court had jurisdiction and power to issue Mandamus after such long delay. According to him even if the petitioner had some right under various Orders issued till 1965 they lost it due to passage of time and change of policy on rational ground. He urged that between 1959 and 1970 there was sea change resulting in supersession of earlier government Orders, therefore, it was not possible for petitioner to invoke superseded policy nor this Court can direct its enforcement. He urged that one of the basic principles for isssuing Mandamus was that the aggrieved person should approach the Court with utmost haste but in this case the petitioners themselves delayed the matter and approached this Court for enforcing orders issued in 1959 and 1960 in 1982. Learned counsel urged that for issuing a Mandamus the Courts have held three dates to be material. The date on which the cause of action accrues or the date on which the petition is filed or the date of hearing of writ petition. He urged that although there was no authority from which it could be gathered which was legally enforceable date yet from the decision in\nA.K. Gopalan v. Government of India\n, AIR 1966 SC 816.\nIt could be inferred that, in absence of any other guidelines the test should be the date of hearing, or the date of filing of counter-affidavit as held in\nTalib Hussain v. State of J. & K.\n, (1971) 3 SCC 118 (AIR 1971 SC 62). And as on none of these dates the government order of 1959 was surviving no direction can be issued by this Court to revive what was already dead.\nReliance was placed on\nKalyan Singh v. State of U.P.\n, AIR 1962 SC 1183 and The Queen v. The Church Wardens (1876) 1 AC 611 and it was urged that no mandamus can be issued  for renewal of lease.\nAccording to learned\ncounsel this court could utmost provide\nguidelines as was done in\nState of U.P. v. Raja Ram Jaiswal\n, AIR 1985 SC 1108.\n32. Relief of Mandamus is granted where no other remedy is available, the order of Mandamus is an order of a most extensive nature It was introduced, to prevent disorder from a failure of justice Abuse of discretion is abominable to our system of law. One of the pnmary purposes of Courts entrusted with responsibility of enforcing Constitution is to control and remedy the injustice arising out of intentional act or accidental omission resulting at times in depressing deficiency and frustrating government policy the success or failure of which largely depends on honesty and sincerity of its officials. The Courts by controlling or remedying abuse of discretion do not assume power for themselves but effect salutary restraint to promote cause of justice and maintain rule of law Even in England theory of prerogative power has been exploded and laws arms to reach into its sphere has been accepted. Lord Dublin in Chandler v. D.P.P. (1964) AC 763. Lord Denning in Laker Airways Ltd. v Department of Trade (1977) QB 643. To argue therefore, that this Court even if it finds injustice arising due to illegal exercise of power o omission to act in accordance with law should refrain from granting relief because of time asking this Court to convert itself into lamentable spectator and not to discharge its role and adjust the law by striking balance between efficient government and protection of citizen against mis-management by its officials. Expense of jurisdiction and depth of power exercised by this Court under\nArticle 226\ncan be measured by yardstick of justice and equity only. Mere delay should not be stumbling block in exercise of writ jurisdiction. Inaction must be associated with carelessness, something like negligence or remissness to convert slackness into laches and disentitle a person from approaching this Court in its extraordinary jurisdiction. But where distance in time is linked with negotiation, representation and its consideration the argument of passage of time stands diluted. Further even though reduction of area, grant of fresh lease as far as possbile to one acre, was in contemplation in 1965 but no clear cut policy was spelt out and when subsequent Orders were issued no such restriction was placed. Till 1976 renewal or grant of fresh lease was reiterated on terms and condition mentioned in 1959-60.\nIn\nYogeshwar Jaiswal v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal\n. AIR 1985 SC 516 it was held, 'delay in performance of statutory duty amounts to continuation of process of law and has to be remedied by the Court particularly when the public interest suffers thereby'.\nIn\nSri Chandra v. State of U.P.\n, AIR 1986 SC 242, a direction was issued after 26 years since there was inordinate delay in passing orders by State government under\nSection 68D\nof Motor Vehicles Act'. Even under law of limitation the right is not lost. It is the remedy which becomes barred. Therefore, unless something becomes impossible of performance it cannot be refused because of passage of time specially when opposite parties were themselves instrumental to it either because of inaction of passing orders or omission to issue notice. As seen earlier Renewal of leases even today either for the entire area or on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959 and 1960 does not present any difficulty. Moreover, the delay was because of negotiations. Renewal or granting fresh leases having been decided by the government in 1959 and reiterated even in 1976 the terms and conditions for the grant of fresh lease could justifiably be a matter of deliberation. Time taken in negotiations or deliberation cannot be considered as delay resulting in laches so as to disentitle the petitioners from seeking the relief of mandamus. Lessees cannot be put to disadvantage when the government kept the doors open for negotiation.\n33. Legal issues having been resolved, rote of Courts defined how should the conflicting interest be reconciled due to confusing dichotomy between State endeavour to protect livelihood, a right recognised in\nOlga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation\n, AIR 1986 SC 180 of numerous out-houses dwellers some coming down from the days of 'gora sahib' and exploited for generations and lessees for whom even late Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru wrote a letter to local Self-Government Minister. Although paragraph 12 of 1981 Order prohibiting lessees from exercising option in respect of such tenements has been held to be invalid. Yet the effect this clause must have had on such dwellers cannot be undermined or ignored. A Welfare State is not only an ideal or a vision but a conviction and necessity. It is the rational basis of a modern State. Its policy implications flow from broad idealogy of economic and social uplift. Whether it was political expediency or necessity which persuaded State Government to assure settlement of such tenements with those residing in it need not be commented upon or gone into but it cannot be disputed that removal of poverty by providing houses to weaker section of the society isa step towards realisation of Welfare State. That such an assurance or even hope having been extended it appears the government should stick to it, and give shape to its intention of providing houses by :\ni) directing Collector, Allahabad to get survey of the bungalows done within a period of two months, if possible, from the date copy of government orders is received by him and get a list prepared of all such dwellers.\nii) It may initiate necessary proceedings immediately for building a colony sufficient to house all such persons at one place.\niii) The colony should be constructed as soon as possible but not beyond five years.\niv) Houses so constructed should be settled or leased to such persons on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the government. But it should be reasonable and within their reach as a part of social and economic uplift.\nv) Such persons shall not be evicted for a period of five years or till the colony is constructed whichever is earlier.\n34. Before parting with these cases we express our profound thanks to Sri S.N. Kacker who led the arguments on behalf of petitioner, Sri Jagdish Swaroop, who concluded the arguments, and Sri S.P. Gupta, Sri S.N. Verma, Sri R.R. Agrawal, Sri K.N. Tripathi, Sri Ravi Kant, Sri A.B. Saran, Sri Shambhu Chopra, Sri R.K. Gulati, Sri R. N. Bhalla, Sri S.C. Budhwar, Sri Gyan Prakash, Sri A.K. Banerji, Sri A.S. Kapur, Sri H.N. Tripathi, Sri Sridhar. We also are extremely grateful to Sri R.N. Trivedi, the learned Additional Advocate General, assisted by Sri Shitla Prasad, for the valuable assistance rendered by him in an upright and fair manner who was willing to produce every document and record and assist the Court at every stage in all possible manner.\n35. In the result these petitions succeed and are allowed. A direction is issued to opposite parties to\n(i) grant fresh leases to all those who had deposited the premium or at least one instalment on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959 Order read with 1960 Order.\n(ii) To issue notices to all those lessees to whom no notice was issued and determine their premium etc on terms and conditions mentioned in 1959-60 Orders expeditiously.\n(iii) To determine premium etc. of others to whom notices were issued but it could not be finalised for one reason or other at any early date.\n(iv) Determine rate of premium etc for premises which are used as residential cum commercial purpose in light of 1965 Order.\n(v) Determine rate of premium used for commercial prupose in light of various Orders issued till 1965.\n(vi) Lessees shall after grant of fresh leases file the necessary forms etc. within one month before the Prescribed Authority under\nUrban Ceiling Act, 1976\n(Act 33 of 76) if it had already not been filed who shall proceed to decide the same as expeditiously as possible.\n36.    Parties shall bear their own costs.",

These are two appeals from the High Court of Judicature at Patna. They have been consolidated, and the central point upon which each appeal turns is the same : which of the parties is to be treated as the lawful owner of the piece of property in dispute? That piece of property is a four annas undivided share out of a fourteen annas partitioned share of an estate called Touzi No. 7898 in Mouza Awari, Pargana Lautana, District Darbhanga, and it is hereinafter referred to as \"the disputed property.\"\n2. The two suits out of which the appeals arise were respectively a partition suit, (No. 89 of 1932) filed by the appellant on September 16, 1982, and a title suit (No. 72 of 1933) filed by the respondents in the second appeal on November 7, 1933. The appellant, who is the mahanth of a math or asthal called the Birpur Asthal, sought by the partition suit to obtain a declaration of his title to the, disputed property and an order for partition of the lands of which that property was an undivided share. He was met by a defence on the part of those respondents who formed the defendants first party to his suit to the effect that on various grounds, some of which will be noticed later, he had no title to the disputed property. These respondents were the mahanth and the deities (acting- through the mahanth) of another math or asthal known as the Pokrauni Asthal, and it was they who instituted the title suit in which they asked for a declaration against the appellant that the disputed property is debottar property of the Pokrauni Astha) and that the appellant had no right to any interest in it. As it is plain that the real question at issue is, to which of these two religious institutions does the disputed property belong, it will be convenient to use the term respondents to refer to the respondents Mahanth Ramfcirpal Das and the idols Sri Thakurji, Ramji, Lachhmanji and Jankiji.\n3. In their Lordships' view, as will appear later, the appellant has a good defence to the title suit under the\nIndian Limitation Act\n(IX of 1908) as subsequently amended, and, although other grounds of appeal were argued before them, it is upon this ground that they think that the appeals should be allowed. So much of the narrative of the complicated history of this case as follows is recorded therefore in order to explain how the question of limitation arises rather than to give any comprehensive account of the various issues in the suits.\n4. The appellant's claim to the disputed property comes through his predecessor as mahanth of the Birpur Asthal, one Priya Das. In the year 1910, Priya Das had lent 500 maunds of grain to the then mahanth of the Pokrauni Asthal. Damodar Das. The loan was not repaid, and on May 16, 1913, Priya Das obtained a decree against Damodar Das in the Court of the Munsiff at Muzaffarpur ordering Damodar Das to pay him the sum of Rs. 1 562-8-0, the monetary equivalent of the loan, together with costs and interest. This was followed by a sale of the disputed property at public auction in execution of the decree. Priya pas was himself the: purchaser, and on April 6, 1915, he received the usual Court certificate confirming his purchase. One of the questions that was in issue in the present suits was the question whether this loan of 500 maunds was for any \"justifying necessity\" of the Pokrauni Asthal itself. The relevance of the enquiry was that, had the loan been made for any such necessity, the disputed property, even if it did belong to the Asthal, instead of being the private property of the mahanth, would have been validly disposed of by an execution sale pursuant to the decree for payment of the value of the loan. The Subordinate Judge, after reviewing the evidence, decided that Damodar Das did not \"run into the debt in question for any justifying necessity of the Asthal.\" On appeal the High Court expressed their agreement with the trial Court on this finding. The appellant sought to challenge the High Court's decision on this point: but in their Lordships' view there are concurrent findings of fact in the two Courts without any apparent misapplication of the relevant law to those facts, and, that being so, an appeal cannot be entertained on that ground.\n5. In the year 1918 a suit (No. 1 of 1918) was instituted against Damodar Das in the Court of the District Judge at Darbhanga. It was a suit under the provisions of\nSection 92\nof the Code of Civil Procedure and in it Rajkumar Das, a former claimant to the office of mahant then held by Damodar Das, and certain other persons interested in the proper administration of the Pokrauni Asthal claimed that Damodar Das ought to be removed from the mahantship, a new mahant appointed in his place, and a scheme of administration settled by the Court for the asthal. It is not necessary to go into the details of these proceedings. In the end, on March 16, 1922, judgment was delivered in the District Court holding that the properties of the asthal were not debottar and that, accordingly, the Court was not entitled to entertain the suit under Section 92. An appeal from this decision was taken to the High Court, but while the appeal was still pending, Damodar Das died, being succeeded in the mahantship by the present respondent Ramkirpal Das, and Rajkumar Das abandoned the appeal.\n6. The dates of three events incident to this suit should be mentioned. On September 10, 1918, the Court appointed a receiver of the asthal properties. On August 28, 1919, an ex parte decree was made declaring that the Pokrauni Asthal had trust properties and removing Damodar Das from the mahantship. On September 12, 1919, Rajkumar Das was appointed mahant in his place. These steps in the proceedings were however set aside on appeal to the High Court and the judgment given on the rehearing in the District Court on March 16, 1922, was inconsistent with the basis on which they were made. It follows that after that judgment Damodar Das must have resumed his mahantship\n7. While the 1918 suit was in progress, the appellant, who had by that time succeeded Priya Das, instituted a suit (No. 226 of 1919) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Darbhanga asking for a declaration of his title to the disputed property (of which Priya Das had apparently been dispossessed) and for possession. Damodar Das was made a defendant to this suit, but no other person who could possibly be said to represent the interest of the Pokrauni Asthal. Since Damodar Das had been removed from the mahantship by Court order on August 28, 1919. Rajkumar Das being installed in his place, and Damodar Das could not have returned to the position of mahant until the order removing him had been upset, it seems clear that during much, if not all, of the progress of the Suit No. 226 of 1919 there was no party to it who could act on behalf of the Pokrauni Asthal. However that may be, judgment was given in the suit on June 26, 1920, declaring that the appellant was entitled to the disputed property and ordering that he should get possession over it with Damodar Das and another defendant interested in other undivided shares. An appeal against this judgment was dismissed, and on September 23, 1920, the appellant was given formal possession of \"the property mentioned in the writ of delivery of possession \"by the officer of the Court. It is difficult to tell from the actual form of the officer's report whether he is certifying that he delivered possession of the property comprised in the whole 14 annas share (which would be a joint possession of all co-owners) or of the undivided four annas share of that property. But, whatever form the delivery itself took, there is no reasonable doubt as to the nature of the possession that the appellant in fact enjoyed thereafter.\n8. The appellant based part of his defence in the present suits upon the contention that the respondents' claim that the property in dispute was debottar property of the asthal was barred by res judicata. The res juiicata, he said, arose out of the decision in Suit No. 1 of 1918 or the decision in Suit No. 228 of 1919. This contention was rejected by the trial Court and by the High Court on appeal. It was relied upon in argument during the appeal before the Board, but their Lordships do not find it necessary to express any decided view upon it. They will content themselves with observing that there appear to be formidable difficulties to be surmounted before it could succeed.\n9. The question of limitation has now to be dealt with. Limitation was an issue both in the partition suit and in the title suit. In both cases the trial Judge held that there was no bar by limitation and, so holding, decided the title suit in favour of the respondents, since he came to the conclusion that the property in dispute-was debottar property of the Pokrauni Asthal and that the execution sale of 1914 had been ineffective to deprive the asthal of its title to the property. This being his decision as to title, he dismissed the appellant's partition suit as misconceived. The High Court upheld his view that the title suit was not barred by limitation and that the Pokrauni Asthal was entitled to recover the disputed property as its own. They did not have before them the question whether the partition suit had been correctly decided not to be barred by limitation. Nor have their Lordships. No argument was placed before them on behalf of the respondents to this effect, and limitation as a bar to the partition suit needs, therefore, no further consideration.\n10. The schedule to the\nIndian Limitation Act\ncontains several articles that might be thought to have an application to the title suit. The first important question is, which is the governing article? The Subordinate Judge rightly, as their Lordships think, took the view that he was faced with a choice between Article 134B, which was introduced by amendment in 1929, and\nArticle 144.\nHe decided wrongly; as their Lordships think, in favour of applying Article 184B. That article runs as follows:\nBy the manager of a Hindu, Mohammedan or Buddhist religious or charitable endowment to recover possession of immoveable property comprised in the endowment which has been transferred by a previous manager for a valuable consideration. Twelve years from the death, resignation or removal of the transferor.\nArticle 144\non the other hand runs :\nFor possession of immoveable property or any interest therein not hereby otherwise specifically provided, Twelve years from the time when the possession becomes adverse to the plaintiff.\n11. Treating the execution sale of 1914 as a transfer by a previous manager for valuable consideration, he held that the relevant date for the commencement of the bar by limitation was the death of Damodar Das, namely, September 13, 1922. As the title suit was brought in November, 1933, it was, on that basis, within time. The learned Judge also held that, even if\nArticle 144\napplied, the period of limitation would not begin to run until the death of the \"vendor,\" namely, the occupying Mahant, Damodar Das, He regarded the decision of their Lordships' Board in\nMahadeo Prasad Singh v. Karia Bharti\n(1934) I.L.R. 62 I.A. 47, s.c. 37 Bom. L.R. 333 as establishing this. He seems to have thought that in any event adverse possession for the purpose of\nArticle 144\ndid not begin until Ramkirpal Das succeeded Damodar Das. In the result he considered the only relevant date to be September 13, 1922.\n12. The High Court dealt only briefly with this issue in their judgment. They regarded\nMahadeo Prasad Singh\n's case (supra) as authority for the view that limitation would begin to run from the death of the mahant and not from the date of alienation.\n13. Their Lordships cannot accept that the death of Damodar Das is the commencing date for limitation in this case. No doubt it would be if Article 134B were to be applied. But to apply it involves a reading of that article which would construe the words \"transferred by a previous manager for a valuable consideration\" as covering an execution sale under Court process, and the word \"transferor\" as extending to the judgment-debtor whose land is sold. In their view such a construction cannot be adopted. It is not only that the words themselves do not properly bear that meaning. Apart from that, what is in all essentials the same question was considered on several occasions by Courts in India before\nArticles 134A\nand 134B had been added to\nArticle 134\n, That article contains the analogous phrase \"transferred by the trustee or mortgagee for a valuable consideration,\" and there was a uniform current of decision to the effect that these words were incapable of applying to an execution sale. See, for instance,\nAhamed Kutti v. Raman Nambudri\n(1901) I.L.R. 25 Mad. 99.\nF.B. and Charu Chandra Pramanik v. Nahush Chandra Kundu\n(1922) I.L.R. 50 Cal. 49. Accepting this construction their Lordships are unable to hold that Article 134B has any application to the present suit.\n14. The consequence is that\nArticle 144\nis the governing article, since the rejection of Article 134B involves also the rejection of\nArticle 134\nand\n134A.\nAt what date then did the possession of the appellant become adverse to the respondents? The reasoning of the Courts below answers this question by selecting the date of the death of Damodar Das, since they draw an analogy between what would have been the position had Damodar Das, for instance, himself sold the disputed property to provide money for the payment of Priya Das's loan and the position that in fact arose when the disputed property was sold in execution to satisfy the judgment decree for the value of the loan. In the former case, it is said, adverse possession of the disputed property would not have begun during the incumbency of the existing mahant. This last contention is based on the decision of their Lordships in\nMahadeo Prasad Singh\n's case (supra): hence the reference to that case both in the judgment of the trial Judge and of the High Court. The decision had nothing to do with a sale in execution : but the next step in the argument is that there is no difference in principle between a sale by the mahanth to pay his debts and a sale by the Court to pay his debts for him.\nAnd indeed Lprd Buckmaster so stated when delivering the judgment of the Board in\nSubbaiya Pandaram v. Mohamad Mustapha Maracayar\n(1923) L.R. 50 I.A. 295 : s.c. 25 Bom. L.R. 127.\n15. This argument has much force, but in their Lordships' view it is not open to them to entertain it. To what extent there is a difference in substance, if there is not a difference in principle, between a voluntary sale by a debtor and an execution sale of his property by the Court, it would be otiose at this date to enquire. For the very judgment to which the respondents refer for the observation of Lord Buckmaster in support of their contention contains a decision by the Board that in the case of an execution sale of debottar property it is not the death of the incumbent but the date of alienation (if accompanied, of course, by possession) that is the careening date for adverse possession for the purposes of\nArticle 144.\nAt page 299 of that judgment Lord Buckmaster, after stating that the trustee in office has no power to dispose of trust property by a permanent mukurrari lease, proceeds as follows :\n...though he is at liberty to dispose of it during the period of his life and a, grant made for a longer period is good, but good only to the extent of his own life interest. It follows therefore that possession during his life is not adverse, and that upon his death the succeeding trustee would be at liberty to institute proceedings to recover the estate, and the statute would only run against him from the time when he assumed the office. Such an argument has no relation to the case where, as here, property has been acquired under an execution sale and possession retained throughout.\nThe view that, where land devoted to charitable purposes is sold under an execution decree against the trustee of the charity, the ensuing possession of the purchaser is adverse from the date of sale, was repeated by this Board in\nRam Charan Das v. Naurangi Lal\n(1933) L.R. 60 I.A. 124 : s.c. 35 Bom. L.R. 530. In the face of these authorities their Lordships are bound to hold that adverse possession in this case did not begin with the death of Damodar Das but began at whatever date after the sale in 1914 Priya Das or his successor the appellant obtained effective possession of the disputed property.\n16. Now it is the respondents' case-it is in fact their main contention on this issue-that the appellant has never at any time had \"adverse\" possession against them because, the disputed property being a four-anna undivided share, his possession has been throughout no more than a joint possession with them. And the joint possession which co-parceners enjoy in respect of the undivided property involves that, prima facie, the exclusive possession of any. one of them is not adverse to the others. Their Lordships have no doubt of the validity of this general rule : but they are unable to think that it will be in any way departed from if they hold that in respect of the disputed property itself the appellant's -possession has been adverse to the owners of the other shares. In truth there is some confusion involved in the argument. What is in question here is not adverse possession of the block of property in which the various undivided interests subsist, but adverse possession of one undivided interest.\nArticle 144\ncertainly extends the conception of adverse possession to include an interest in immoveable property as well as the property itself: nor was it disputed in argument by the respondents that there could be adverse possession of an undivided share, given the appropriate circumstances. What they maintained was that such circumstances were lacking in this case. Their Lordships cannot accept this, for the history of the long wrangle over the disputed property suggests a very different conclusion.\n17. It seems clear that at the time of Suit No. 226 of 1919 the appellant was out of possession. His complaint was that Priya Das had been dispossessed after his purchase and the relief that he (the appellant) asked for in the suit was vindication of his title and recovery of possession of the disputed property. This relief the Court gave him by its decree of June 26, 1920, which was affirmed on appeal. It is true that the decree says that he is to get possession over the share claimed by him \"with\" Damodar Das and another party to the suit claiming under Damodar. But there seems to be no doubt, when the judgment itself is read, that what that meant was that the appellant was to have possession of his share, the disputed property, without the necessity of claiming an actual partition of the undivided property. It could mean nothing else in the light of the declaration of his sole title to the disputed share which the Court granted to him at the same time. Everything that followed is consistent with this.\n18. On September 23, 1920, he was formally installed in possession by the officer of the Court. From that date until some time in the year 1934 he remained in actual possession of the disputed property. That is established by the findings of the Additional Subordinate Judge at Darbhanga, to whom, pending the final decision of the High Court appeal, the case had been remitted with an instruction that he should try certain issues, and should endeavour to ascertain the period during which the appellant was in actual possession. It appears from these findings (which must be treated as displacing the indeterminate findings as to the facts and period of possession which are contained in the original judgment of the Subordinate Judge) that the acts of possession consisted in the collection, whether by legal proceedings or by other means, of the appellant's share of the rents arising from the undivided property. The collection of this share could not have taken place on behalf of those interested in the undivided property generally, including those interested in the other undivided shares. On the contrary, the quantum of total rent taken was taken because the appellant had vindicated his title to the disputed property (whether or not he had succeeded in making parties to the 1919 suit persons who would properly represent the Pokrauni Asthal) and was now insisting upon his right to receive and retain for the Birpur Asthal a four-anna share of the total rent. It appears to their Lordships that such possession was plainly an adverse possession for the purposes of\nArticle 144.\n19. If this is so, it follows that when the title suit was instituted on November 7, 1933, the appellant had been for over 12 years in adverse possession. Consequently the suit must be treated as barred by limitation. If the respondents are thus precluded from disputing the appellant's title tp his share, it follows that the partition suit must succeed.\n20. Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal should be allowed and that the two decrees of the Additional Subordinate Judge at Darbhanga dated June 30, 1935, and the two decrees of the High Court at Patna dated March 20, 1942, should be set aside and that the respondents should pay to the appellant his costs in those Courts. In place of these decrees the title suit should be dismissed and the partition suit remitted to the Court of the Additional Subordinate-Judge at Darbhanga with instructions to proceed with the case in accordance with this judgment. Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly. The respondents must pay the appellant's costs of this appeal.",

In the suit out of which this appeal has arisen the plaintiffs claimed, among other reliefs, possession of a share in the village of Baukata, and it is this part of the claim with which we are concerned in this appeal. It appears that certain co-sharers in the aforesaid village applied for partition of their shares under\nSection 107\nof the Land Revenue Act. Notice was issued to all the recorded co-sharers as required by\nSection 110\nof the Act, and thereupon an application was made on the 11th of September, 1912, by [the parties to this suit and other co-sharers under Clause (2) of the section, praying for partition of their shares. In that application they set forth the extent of the shares which they prayed should be formed into one lot or qura. After this application was made, a proceeding was drawn up by the Revenue Court under\nSection 114\nof the Act, declaring the basis upon which partition was to be effected, and in that proceeding the extent of the plaintiffs' share was put down as that mentioned in the application to which I have referred. Nearly a year after this, that is, in August, 1913, the plaintiffs instituted the present suit. The question to be determined is whether the suit is barred by the provisions of\nSection 233 (k)\nof the Land Revenue Act. I should have considered that the point was fully concluded by authority in this Court, had it not been for the decision in the recent case of\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All. 243. In my opinion the present suit is in substance a suit in respect of the partition of a mahal within the meaning of Clause (k) of Section 233. That section provides that no Civil Court shall take cognizance of a suit in respect of the several matters mentioned in the section. One of these matters is \"partition or union of mahals, except as provided in Sections 111 and 112.\"\nIn determining whether the section applies we have to look to the substance of the claim and not to the form in which it is dressed up. If, as observed by STRACHEY, C. J., in Muhammad Sadiq v. Laute Ram (1901) I.L.R. 23 All. 291, the object of the suit is to establish the plaintiffs ownership and possession in respect of property as to which the revenue authorities in making a partition have declared that it should go to the defendant, that is a matter relating to partition, and a Civil Court is forbidden to take cognizance of it by the provisions of Section 233. I am unable to distinguish this case from the case last mentioned, which is very similar to the present. It is a Full Bench decision by five Judges of this Court, and the view taken in it was held in subsequent cases also. I see no reason to depart from the course of rulings on the point. No question of res judicata, in my opinion, arises in a case like this. Had the question of the title of the parties been decided by the Revenue Court under Sections 111 and 112, the matter would have been res judicata. In my opinion the present suit is barred by reason of the prohibition contained in Section 233, and not on the ground of res judicata.\nIt is not necessary for the purposes of this case to say whether I agree or disagree with the ruling in\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All. 243\nreferred to above\n, as the facts of that case are different from those of the present case, but if it is deemed that the principle involved\nin that case\nis the same as that which arises in this, I am unable, with great deference, to acquiesce in all that was said\nin that case\n. In my judgement the decision of the learned Judge, of this Court from which this appeal has been preferred undo the Letters Patent is correct and I would dismiss the appeal.\nTudball, J.\n2. The facts of the case have just been stated by my learned colleague Banerji, J. It is unnecessary to rep eat them. In substance the present suit is merely an effort to turn round and annul the partition made by the Revenue Court. The appellants were parties to that partition, the property in dispute was the subject matter of that very proceeding and the present case is nothing but a very very clear instance to which Section 233, Clause (k), applies beyond doubt. The case is clearly distinguishable from the case of\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All. 243, for in that suit the subject matter thereof had not been the subject matter of a partition case in any way at all. I would dismiss the appeal.\nHenry Richards, C.J.\n3. The facts have been fully stated by my learned brother Banerji. The property claimed by the plaintiff in the present suit has in recent partition proceedings been allotted to the defendants. The plaintiff was a party to these proceedings and there is no doubt that he could then have put forward the title he now alleges (\nSections 111-112\n, Land Revenue Act). While I do not agree with my learned brothers that the present suit is barred by the provisions of Section 233 (k), I quite appreciate the objection of allowing parties to partition proceedings in the Revenue Court to re-open in the Civil Court questions of title which could, and ought, to have been decided before partition, in the manner provided by the Revenue Act. If the result of the view taken by the majority of the Court in this case is to settle, that parties to partition proceedings in the Revenue Court cannot re-open questions of title in the Civil Court, which have been or ought to have been decided before partition, some good and little harm will probably be done, particularly if the Revenue Courts by their rules and practice give proper facility and opportunity for the raising and decision of such questions. If, however, as a consequence of our decision persons are prevented from asserting their rights in the Civil Court merely because of partition proceedings in the Revenue Court to which they were not parties] (or in which they were not interested to assert such rights) grave injustice will often be done. The only question for decision in the present appeal is whether or not the Civil Court could take cognizance of the present suit having regard to the provisions of\nSection 233 (k)\nof the Land Revenue Act. The suit is in form a suit which is brought every day in the Civil Court. It is an ordinary suit for possession of land. Possession of the land in dispute is the appropriate relief for the plaintiff to seek. It is only after, at least partial investigation, that the suit could possibly be said to have been instituted contrary to the provisions of Section 233 (k), notwithstanding the partition proceedings. One at least of my colleagues would, I think, have held the suit cognizable had it not been for the fact that the plaintiff was a party to the proceeding in the Revenue Court.\nIn the case of\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 88 All. 243, there had also been partition proceedings and the plaintiff was seeking to recover possession of property which had been dealt with (wrongly it is true) in those proceedings. The court below had held that the suit was barred by Section 233 (k).\nI gave my reasons at some length\nin that case\nfor holding that the suit was not barred and I referred to another case decided about the same time by the same Bench;\nKalka Prasad v. Manmohan Lal\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All. 302. My brother Tudball expressed his concurrence in both cases. I did not understand him to take exception to anything I said in the course of my judgement.\nAt the same time it must be admitted that the facts in the case of\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 88 All. 243, differ materially, at least on the merits. It is, however, common to all three cases that there had been recent partition proceedings in the Revenue Court and the property in dispute in the Civil Court had been dealt with by the Revenue Court in the partition proceedings. Section 233 (k) provides that \"No person shall institute any suit or other proceeding in the Civil Court with respect to partition or union of mahals. except as provided by Sections 111-112.\" The question is, what is the meaning of \"partition or union of mahals V The expression \"partition\" is followed by the expression \"union of mahals.\" In the course of the argument it was said, (with the approval of both my colleagues) that \"partition\" meant the opposite of \"union of mahals.\" I agree, and think that the word \"partition\" and the word \"union of mahals\" refer to \"units\" of area which the revenue authorities create in tie course of partition proceedings. If this is the correct meaning of the expressions, the institution of the present suit was not contrary to the provisions of Section 233(k). If the plaintiff in this suit was successful, the property would remain in the same unit in which it was placed by the Revenue Court, notwithstanding the plaintiff's decree for possession. The \"unit\" would not be affected, though the ownership of the property in it would be. If the meaning which I give is the correct meaning, then a suit which seeks to affect a \"unit\" created by the Revenue Court as a \"unit\" cannot be instituted by any person whether he was or was not a party to partition proceedings and the meaning of a badly drawn section becomes comparatively clear. There are obvious reasons why the Legislature might have confined the power of altering and creating revenue areas (which for the want of a better name I call \"units\") to the Revenue Courts. The reasons for the exclusion (even partial exclusion) of the power to decide questions of title or the right to possession to property in those units for the Civil Court is not so obvious. My learned colleagues agreed that \"partition\" meant the opposite of  union of mahals,\" still they seem to think that it also means the determination of the title to the specific land allotted. It seems to me that to assert that there has been no \"partition\" in the Revenue Court because the plaintiff was not a party to those proceedings is to assert contrary to fact The section does not say that a person cannot institute a suit in respect of a partition to which he was a party. It seems to me that the very words \"except as provided by Sections 111-112\" show that the expression \"partition\" is not confined to divisions actually made, because Sections 111-112 contemplate the raising of questions of title before partition. The section cannot be read as meaning that no person can institute a suit in the Civil Court which can in any way affect a contemplated division of zamindari. Such suits are instituted every day before any proceedings are taken in the Revenue Court and appear to be recognized by\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n. The rights of the parties are declared by the Civil Court and it is only the actual division that is carried out by the Revenue Court. If you give any meaning to the expression \"partition\" other than the meaning I have given it and substitute that other meaning of the word \"partition,\" and then read the section giving the language its ordinary meaning and I think you will find that confusion at once, arises. It is said that the words \"except as provided by Sections 111-112\" show that the expression \"partition\" means or at least includes the actual division as between the parties and the determination of their title. It may possibly be that the framers of the section hoped the introduction of these words would prevent subsequent questions of title being raised. Another explanation might be to obviate some contradiction or inconsistency between Sections 111-112 and Section 233 (k). If the Legislature intended to prevent questions of title being re-opened after partition, it would have been simpler, fairer, and less calculated to do injustice if the rules of \"res judicata\" as\nlaid down in\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\nhad been incorporated.\nIt is unnecessary for me to repeat what I have said in my judgements in\nKalka Prasad v. Manmohan Lal\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All.\n302 and\nShambhu Singh v. Daljit Singh\n(1916) I.L.R. 38 All. 243. As the view of the majority of the Court will prevail, I need not consider what the order of this Court would have been had the views of my colleagues coincided with mine.\n4. The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed with costs.",

Dutt\nBench:\nM.M. Dutt\nJUDGMENT\n\n \n\nM.M. Dutt, J.\n1. This appeal is at the instance of the plaintiff and it arises out of a suit for declaration of the plaintiffs title to the disputed property and partition of the same by metes and bounds.\n2. The appeal involves a point of law of first impression relating to the construction of\nSection 23\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The point is whether a transferee of the female heirs is entitled to claim partition of the dwelling house when the male heir does not choose to divide his share therein. In other words, whether the restriction imposed by\nSection 23\non a female heir to claim partition also applies to her transferee. In order to appreciate and consider the point, the facts of the case may be stated in brief.\n3. The disputed property which is the dwelling house belonged to the father of the appellant, late Motilal Sanyal. He died intestate on May 30, 1960 leaving behind him his widow Khiroda Sundari Dasi, two sons, namely, the appellant and the respondent No. 1 and three daughters, Atasi, Anima and Anurupa, as his heirs under the\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\n. Each of the said heirs inherited l/6th share in the disputed dwelling house. The appellant transferred his undivided l/6th share which he inherited from his father to his elder brother, the respondent No. 1 by a deed of sale dated July 6, 1962. The appellant's mother made a gift of her undivided l/6th share to the respondent No. 1 by a registered deed of gift dated October 30, 1961. The respondent No. 1 thus acquired a half share in the dwelling house. Atasi and Anima gifted their respective 1/6th shares in the dwelling house to the appellant by two registered deeds of gift both dated February 11, 1964. The appellant, therefore, acquired 1/3rd share in the dwelling house. The third sister Anurupa, however, retained her 1/6th share in the dwelling house. The suit has been filed by the appellant on the ground that joint possession of the dwelling house is inconvenient. He has also prayed for a declaration of his l/3rd share which he acquired by gift from his two sisters.\n4. The main defence of the respondents Nos. 1 and 2, namely, the elder brother and the younger sister of the appellant, who contested the suit was that the appellant being the transferee of his sisters Atasi and Anima had no right to claim partition of the dwelling house and as such the suit was not maintainable. The learned Subordinate Judge upheld the said contention and came to the finding that in view of\nSection 23\nof the Hindu Succession Act, the appellant being a transferee of the female heirs specified in class I of the schedule to the said Act was not entitled to claim partition of the dwelling house. Upon this finding, he held that the suit was not maintainable and dismissed the same. Hence, this appeal.\n5. In order to consider the propriety of the said finding of the learned Subordinate Judge and the respective contention of the parties, it is necessary to refer to\nSection 23\nwhich runs as follows:\n\"Special provision respecting dwelling-houses -- Where a Hindu intestate has left surviving him or her both male and female heirs specified in class 1 of the Schedule and his or her property includes a dwelling-house wholly occupied by members of his or her family, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the right of any such female heir to claim partition of the dwelling-house shall not arise until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein; but the female heir shall be entitled to a right of residence therein:\nProvided that where such female heir is a daughter, she shall be entitled to a right of residence in the dwelling-house only if she is unmarried or has been deserted by or has separated from her husband or is a widow.\"\n6.\nSection 23\nis a special provision respecting dwelling-houses. It will apply only when a Hindu dies intestate leaving, both male and female heirs specified in class I. There can be no doubt that a female heir specified in class I of the Schedule inherits a share in the dwelling-house absolutely. But the rule laid down in\nSection 23\npostpones the right of such a female heir to claim partition of the dwelling-house until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein. The object behind the rule seems to be to prevem fragmentation or disintegration of a family dwelling house. It is based on the same principle as embodied in\nSection 44\nof the Transfer of Property Act and\nSection 4(1)\nof the Partition Act The female heir is debarred from claiming partition of the dwelling-house except on the happening of a contingency, namely, when the male heirs come to a division of the same. So long as that contingency does not happen the female heir is precluded from claiming partition.\n7. The difficulty has been created by the words \"until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein.\" There may be a case where a Hindu dies leaving a male heir and a female heir of class I of the Schedule. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that in such a case, the restriction imposed by\nSection 23\nwill not apply, for in the absence of 'male heirs' there is no chance of the contingency to happen. On the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the respondents that applying the provision of\nSection 13(2)\nof the General Clauses Act, the words 'male heirs' should be read as 'male heir'.\nSection 13(2)\ninter alia provides that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa. Prima facie it does not appear that there is anything repugnant in the subject or context to the applicability of\nSection 13(2)\n. But a further difficulty has been created by the word 'respective' which apparently stands in the way of the applicability of\nSection 13(2)\n. Even if the words 'male heirs' also include the singular, that is, 'male heir', no effect can be given to it in the presence of the word 'respective'. It is beyond the purview of the Court to omit the said word from the section for the purpose of giving effect to the provision of\nSection 13(2)\n.\n8. If\nSection 13(2)\ncould be applied there would not have been any difficulty. But as it is inapplicable it is necessary to ascertain the intention of the legislature. It is clear from the section that the legislature does not approve of division of a dwelling-house at the instance of a female heir against the will of the male heirs. This restriction which has been imposed by\nSection 23\nprevents fragmentation or disintegration of a family dwelling house at the instance of the female heirs to the hardship and difficulties to which the male heirs may be put. A Hindu may die leaving a son and a number of daughters. If at the instance of any such daughters the dwelling-house is allowed to be partitioned against the wish of the son, he may be put to great hardship. The house may not be capable of partition and in that case it will have to be sold. If, in such a case, it is held that\nSection 23\nis inapplicable because of the absence of male heirs as contended on behalf of the appellant, in our view, it will defeat and frustrate the very purpose for which the section has been enacted. In the first instance, the section imposes a bar when it provides \"the right of any such female heir to claim partition of the dwelling-house shall not arise\", but the bar is removed only on the happening of the contingency, namely, when the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares therein. It may be that there is one male heir and one female heir and there may not be any chance of that contingency to happen, but that will be no ground to say that the section is inapplicable. The rule which has been laid down by\nSection 23\nclearly indicates the intention of the legislature that female heirs should not be allowed to divide the dwelling-house against the will of the male heirs and, on a proper construction of the section, we are of the view that it is also the intention of the legislature when there is only one male heir. If the male heir chooses to divide the dwelling-house, undoubtedly the female heir or heirs will be entitled to claim partition, but so long as no such choice is actually exercised the female heirs are debarred from claiming partition.\n9. It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the bar imposed by\nSection 23\non a female heir is only a personal bar and is removed when, a female heir looses her share or interest in the dwelling-house for any reason including that when she transfers the same to another. It is said that the appellant being the transferee of his sisters, the bar which was on them will not apply to the appellant, for the bar was only a personal bar. It is said that the contention finds support from the proviso to the section providing for the right of residence of the female heir, when she is a daughter, under certain circumstances. Our attention has also been drawn to\nSection 22\nof the Act which confers a right similar to a right of pre-emption on the heirs specified in class I when one of such heirs proposes to transfer his or her interest in the property or business. The right of pre-emption which is conferred by\nSection 22\nand the right of residence under the proviso to\nSection 23\nare no doubt personal rights, but we fail to see how the same have any bearing with the question whether or not the bar under\nSection 23\nis a personal bar. We are not at all impressed with tie contention that the bar is only a personal bar and it comes to an end when the female heir loses her interest in the dwelling-house by transfer of the same to another. It is contended that inasmuch as a son of a predeceased daughter is an heir under class I and is undoubtedly entitled to claim partition of the family dwelling-house, it should be held that the bar imposed under\nSection 23\nis only a personal bar. A son of a predeceased daughter is a class I heir. He does not inherit as an heir of the daughter, but he has been made an indcpendant heir of the Hindu intestate. The case of a transferee of a female heir is completely different and cannot be equaled with that of the son of a pre-deceased daughter. A transferee claims through the female heir; he steps into the shoes of the female heir and has no right indcpcntlant of the right of the female heir which he has acquired by the transfer. In our view, a transferee of a female heir will be subject to the same restriction and prohibition as imposed by\nSection 23\n, namely, that he will be precluded from claiming partition of the dwelling-bouse until the male heirs chose to divide the same.\n10. Mr. Bankim Chandra Dutt, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant has relied on some decisions of this Court laving down the principles of interpretation of statutes, which are summarised as follows:--\nNo Court is entitled to depart from the intention of the Legislature as may be ascertained from the language of the Act only because it is thought either unreasonable of inconvenient. But where two constructions are open the Court may adopt the more reasonable of the two (\nAbdoola Haroon & Co. v. Corporation of Calcutta\n, .\nIn construing any Act of the Legislature, the verbal construction of the particular section in question, if it be plain and simple, must govern the Court in arriving at its conclusion. If there be any doubt or difficulty in the wording of the particular section in question an enquiry is permissible into the history of the enactment and any supposed defect in the former legislation on the subject which it wanted to cure (\nJamuna Prosad v. Motilal Santhana\n, .\nWhere the main object and intention of the Act is clear, it should not be reduced to a nullity by inserting words or amending a clause which would be the duty of the Legislature and not of the Court The grammatical construction should be adhered to, unless it is clearly repugnant to the intention of the Act or unless it leads to some manifest absurdity (\nProvat Kumar Kar v. William Trevelyan Curties Parker\n, .\nThe elementary rule of construction a that it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of a technical legislation are used in the ordinary meaning. If there is nothing appearing in the section itself either to modify or to alter or if there be nothing to qualify the language which the statute contains, it is to be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. If the language is not only plain, but admits of only one meaning, the task of interpretation can hardly be said to arise. It is not allowable to interpret It has no need of interpretation (\nHarendra Nath v. Sm. Dakryamoni Dassi\n, .\nA section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest (\nSm. Gangamoyee Dey v. Manindra Chandra Nuady\n, .\nIf the words of the statute are plain the Court has to accept the plain meaning of the words used by the Legislature (\nSm. Nagendra Bala Hore v. Sree Sree Iswar Dakhina Kali-mala Thakur\n, .\nA statute should be read as a whole and that the construction should be made of all the parts together, and not of one part or section only by itself. Each section should be brought into play and that construction should be pot which does not make one section repugnant to another (\nJhajharia Brothers Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal\n, ).\n11. The principles of law which have been\nlaid down in\nthe aforesaid decisions are quite well settled. The view which we have taken does not militate against any of the principles of interpretation of statutes as\nlaid down in\nthe above decisions. In our view, the construction which has been put by us on\nSection 23\nin the background of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, is in accord with the well-settled rules of construction.\n12. It is next contended on behalf of the appellant that after he had sold his undivided l/6th share in the dwelling-house which he inherited from his father, to his elder brother, the respondent No. 1, it tant-amounted to a division of the house or at least an exercise of choice by him and the respondent No. 1 to divide the same. In support of this contention that a transfer by one co-sharer of his share or interest in the property to another effects a division of the property, gjeat reliance has been placed by Mr. Dutt on a Bench decision of this Court in Basunta Kumar Ghosh v. Moti Lal Ghosh, (1911) 15 Cal WN 555. We are afraid, no such proposition of law has been laid down in that decision. The question which has been considered in that case is the applicability of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act in a suit for partition. It has been held that whether\nSection 4\napplied to the case or not it is a well-known principle of equity which may not be adopted in all partition cases that when it is inconvenient to divide a property that property must be left in the possession of the person in occupation and the other person who cannot conveniently get actual possession, compensated. The principle of law which has been laid down in that decision has no bearing with the contention made on behalf of the appellant. Indeed, we are not aware of any authority which lays down that when one of the co-sharers transfers his interest in a property to another, there is a division of the property. This contention of the appellant, therefore, fails.\n13. In our view, the learned Subordinate Judge was perfectly justified in disallowing the claim of the appellant for partition of the disputed dwelling-house. Before we part with the case, we must dispose of another contention of the appellant. It has been already staled that the appellant has also prayed for a declaration of his l/3rd share in the disputed dwelling-house. Admittedly, the appellant has acquired 1/3rd share from bis two sisters. Mr. Banerjee, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents has admitted that the appellant has l/3rd share in the disputed dwelling-house. The learned Subordinate Judge was, therefore, not justified in dismissing the entire suit, but should have declared the appellant's title to 1/3rd share in the disputed dwelling-house. Although we hold that the appellant is not entitled to claim partition of the disputed dwelling-house, his prayer for a declaration of his title to l/3rd share of the same should be allowed. In these circumstances, we modify the judgment and decree of the learned Subordinate Judge to this extent that the suit is decreed in part only declaring the title of the appellant to l/3rd share in the disputed dwelling-house. The remaining prayers of the appellant as made in the plaint are disallowed.\n14. The appeal is allowed in part only to the extent indicated above. But in view of the facts and circumstances of the case we direct each party to bear his or her costs in this Court as well as in the Court below.\nN.C. Mukherji, J.\n15. I agree.",

Misra, C.J.\n1. The plaintiffs are the petitioners. They filed Original Suit No. 24 of 1968 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Balasore, for partition of the disputed property consisting of 2.30 acres. The plaint allegation was that the disputed property belonged to late Narayan Sahu who died leaving behind a son (defendant No. 4) and two daughters (defendants 5 and 6). He is said to have acquired this land by a patta and about 11 years before the suit he entered into a contract with the plaintiff No. 1 for selling the northern half of the suit property. He took an advance of Rs. 200/-and delivered possession of the northern half but died before he could execute the sale deed. Plaintiff No. 1 (petitioner No. 1) built a house on the northern part of the suit plot after possession was delivered to him and was residing and carrying on his business there. The house was, however, washed away in the unprecedented floods of 1961 and the petitioner received compensation for the loss of the house from Government. After the death of Narayan Sahu plaintiff No. 1 made repeated requests for execution of sale deed by defendants 4 to 6. Defendant No. 4 did not execute any sale deed. Defendants 5 and 6 however executed a registered sale deed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of their two-thirds share of the suit property from the northern side of the suit lands, on 30-12-67 on receipt of proper consideration. Thus, the plaintiffs acquired title and are in possession of two-thirds. Defendant No. 4 sold his one-third share to defendants 1 to 3 by a registered sale deed on 4-10-61. That sale is collusive, fraudulent and without consideration. Defendants 1 to 3 had notice of the prior contract executed by Narayan Sahu in favour of the plaintiff.\n2. Defendants 1 to 3 contested the suit alleging denial of notice of the previous contract. They claimed that the disputed land was Anabadi and belonged to them as a part of their ancestral estate and had fallen to their share in a partition of the estate. After vesting of the estate they came to know that the property has been leased out in favour of Narayan Sahu, though the property was in their possession and enjoyment. They stated that in good faith they purchased the suit land except for 0.02 1/2 acre from defendant No. 4, and continued in possession. Plaintiffs' title and possession were denied.\n3. Gouri Bewa is the aunt of Amulya Ch. Mohapatra and they are members of a joint family. They filed a petition under Order 1, Rule 10(2),\nC.P.C\n. for being impleaded as parties alleging that the late Upendra, father of Amulya, had acquired the suit property from the landlords by virtue of a patta and was in possession of the same. The petitioners were in possession in their own right after the death of Upendra and were paying rents in respect thereof.\n4. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the application. Against that order the plaintiffs have filed this civil revision.\n5. Mr. R.K. Mohapatra contends that the learned Subordinate Judge exercised his jurisdiction illegally and with material irregularity in allowing the prayer of third party interveners to be impleaded, on the only ground that multiplicity of suits will be avoided even though the title claimed by the third-party interveners is adverse to, and quite distinct from, the title claimed by both the plaintiffs and the defendants, and that the effect of the order impleading them would be to compel the plaintiffs to proceed against a party in respect of a question of title foreign to that between the plaintiffs and the defendants against their wishes.\n6. This contention requires careful examination. On either side, a large many authorities of different High Courts in India have been cited. It is not necessary to go through them as the identical question has been traversed in a series of decisions of this Court.\nIn ILR (1963) Cut 841 = (AIR 1963 Orissa 186) (\nNarahari Mohanty v. Ghanashyam Bal\n) this Court observed as follows:\n\"Two conditions must, however, be satisfied before a party is considered to be a necessary party. They are: (i) there must be a right to some relief against the party not joined. This means that no decree can be passed without affecting the rights of the absentee-party and (ii) the presence of the absentee-party should be necessary in order to enable the court: to effectually adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the suit. This concept includes the idea that no decree should be passed by a court which would be rendered infructuous or would become ultimately inexecutable. If a case satisfies these tests, then the absentee-party is a necessary party and the suit cannot be effectually and completely adjudicated upon in respect of all questions involved, without that party being impleaded in the suit.\"\nThe question in issue would be examined in the light of these tests.\n7. In (1968) 34 Cut LT 956 (Damodar Mohapatra v. State of Orissa) the question was examined from another point of view. It was contended therein that the plaintiff being generally dominus litis there was no principle of justice upon which he can be compelled to fight against some other litigant not of his own choice, unless such a person is required by positive rule of law. The expression \"all the questions involved in the suit\" in Order 1, Rule 19 (2)\nC.P.C\n. was canvassed to be confined only to questions as between the parties to the litigation. This narrow view of the powers conferred on the Court under Order 1, Rule 10(2) was not accepted in that case. It was laid down therein that in a suit relating to property, in order that a person may be added as a party he should have a direct interest as distinct from a commercial interest in the subject-matter of the litigation. Some of the decisions cited now by the learned Advocates were critically examined in that case.\nIn (1968) 34 Cut LT 1410 (\nKartick Chandra Mohanty v. State of Orissa\n) both the aforesaid decisions were noticed and this Court accepted the wider view. It was held that the expression \"questions involved in the suit\" in Order 1, Rule 10 (2) need not be confined only to questions as between the parties to the litigation. Third parties are also entitled to be impleaded under the rule, as parties to the suit provided the two tests\nlaid down in\nILR  1963  Cut  841  are fulfilled.\nIt is needless to add that the concluion in each individual case would follow according to the facts and circumstances of that case.\n8. Before, however, applying the aforesaid two tests, it would be appropriate to critically examine the question to be determined in between the plaintiffs and the defendants in this litigation. Plaintiffs asked for partition on the assumption that they have a valid title to two-thirds of the disputed property. Defendants 1 to 3 contest the plaintiffs' case for partition alleging that they have no title at all. Thus, before the relief of partition can be granted, plaintiffs' title must be gone into. If the plaintiffs fail to establish the title of their vendor, the suit for partition must fail.\n9. In this context, the question for consideration is whether the title set up by the interveners should be gone into, to effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle the question of title involved in the suit.\nIn my view the plaintiffs have a right to the relief against the interveners if their case of title is ultimately accepted to be true. Thus, no decree can be passed in favour of the plaintiffs without affecting the rights of, the absentee-parties.\n10. The second test is also applicable. If the interveners are not added as parties, the decree passed by the Court in favour of the plaintiffs would be rendered infructuous as the interveners claim possession in the land also, and the decree would become ultimately inexecutable. When the question of title would be gone into, no confusion would be introduced in allowing the interveners to get their title canvassed, in the same litigation.\n10A. As has already been stated, it is unnecessary to refer to the various authorities cited by Mr. Mohapatra which can be distinguished on the ground that they are based on a narrow construction of Order 1, Rule 10(2) which has been rejected by this Court.\nIt would, however, be instructive to refer to AIR 1927 Mad 834 (\nChidambaram Chettiar v. Subramaniam Chettiar\n), where the following passage occurs:--\n\"The Code does not contemplate a triangular duel of this sort in which one plaintiff shoots at the other, and both at the defendants. And if joinder of plaintiffs is impossible under Order 1, Rule 1, it does not become possible under Order 1, Rule 10.\"\nThat case is distinguishable as the interveners wanted to be added as plaintiffs and the provision that came in for consideration was Order 1, Rule 10(2) read with Order 1, Rule 1,\nC.P.C\n. But the real point is whether a triangular duel is wholly out of the purview of Order 1, Rule 10. I am not inclined to accept the broad proposition\nlaid down in\nthe aforesaid passage.\nIn fact, in AIR 1940 Mad 225 (\nMangacharyulu v. Balarama Krishnamacharyulu\n) such an argument was raised and it was contended that allowing such an application (by the sister of the plaintiff) will lead to a triangular fight about title and the effect of including her as a party would be to convert the suit, which was one in ejectment to a suit based on title. The contention was rejected.\n11.\nIn AIR 1958 SC 886 (\nRazia Begum v. Anwar Begum\n) the majority held that it has been firmly established--as a result of judicial decisions that, in order that a person may be added as a party to a suit, he should have a direct interest in the subject-matter of the litigation, whether it raises questions relating to moveable or immoveable property and that he should not have merely commercial or indirect interest. The position of law is the same in England. Order XVI, Rule 11, R.S.C. corresponds to Order 1, Rule 10(2)\nC.P.C\n. It has been consistently held in English law that a proprietary right of the intervener in the subject-matter of the action is sufficient to entitle him to be impleaded as a party to the suit. The law has been further extended to cover cases where the right is akin to property right.\nIn (1878) 9 Ch D 351 (Vavasseur v. Krupp) an intervener was allowed to be impleaded as a party defendant as he claimed proprietary right in the subject-matter of the action.\nThis principle was consistently followed as would appear from two recent decisions of the English courts.\nIn (1950) 2 All ER 605, Dollfus Mieg et Compagnie v. Bank of England, the facts were as follows. A French company was the owner of 64 identifiable gold bars which were looted by the Germans during their occupation of France and were later found and seized by the Allied Armies. The custody of the bars was acquired by a tripartite Commission consisting of the representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom. United States of America and France which was set up under treaty arrangements between the United Nations for the purpose of acquiring and eventually distributing, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, the gold and treasure looted by the Germans. The 64 gold bars were conveyed to England and deposited by the Commission with the Bank of England; on learning this, the French Company asserted its claim to them. On 18-10-48 the company issued the writ in an action against the bank claiming delivery up of the bars or damages for their detention. The bank applied for an order to set aside the writ and all subsequent proceedings    on    the ground that the bars were in possession or under the control of the three Governments and that the action impleaded two foreign sovereign States who declined   to submit to the jurisdiction.    The case proceeded on the basis that the bars    were returnable in specie to the three Governments on demand and the learned Judge made the order which     was asked  for. The company appealed.    At the appellate stage the  Governments    of    the    United States  of  America     and   France   applied under R.S.C. XVI, Rule 11 to be added as defendants to the action.    For the purpose of the application they did not assert title  to  the  bars,   but  contended  that    if they could establish that they had possession and control over them,  through the bank,  the company would fail to    obtain from the court an order in its favour by reason of the doctrine of immunity which applied  to  foreign  sovereign  States    and therefore the applicants would retain possession and control over the bars and be able to dispose of them.    Wynn-Parry, J., held that in determining whether or   not the applicants had proprietary rights    in the subject-matter of the action sufficient to entitle them to be joined as defendants, the test lay, not so much in  an analysis of what were the    constituents    of their rights,  but rather in what would be the result on the subject-matter of the action if their rights could be established.    Although the applicants did not assert title to the bars the result of a successful intervention by them would be that as between the company and themselves they would, for all  practical  purposes,  be    the    true owners and therefore although their right arose indirectly,  viz.,  by     the  invocation of the doctrine of immunity and through the  bank  as  bailee,  they    had     a  direct interest in the subject-matter of the action which was similar to a proprietary right and was of such a nature as would entitle them to an order that they be  joined as defendants,  if it could  be shown that in their absence, their claim could not effectually be put forward.\nIn (1956) 1 All ER 273 (Amon v. Raphael Tuck & Sons) the facts were as follows. Plaintiff alleged that he was the inventor of a new design of adhesive dispenser in the shape of a pen known as the Fastik pen; that he disclosed the \"know how\" of the pen to the defendants during negotiations for an agreement whereby the defendants were to market the pen; that in February 1954 the negotiations broke down; that there was an implied contract that the defendants would treat as confidential the information given to them during the negotiations; and that the defendants were in breach of that contract in that they had made use of the information by manufacturing an adhesive dispenser called the Stixit pen which contained three distinctive features of the Fastic pen. The plaintiff claimed damages against the defendant and an injunction to restrain them from disclosing to other persons or making use of the information disclosed by the plaintiff without his consent. The defendants before filing a defence applied by summons under R.S.C. Order XVI, Rule 11, for leave to join as a defendant. The intervener filed an affidavit alleging that he was the inventor of the Stixit pen. Subsequently he filed another affidavit alleging that the defendants were under contractual obligation to him to manufacture and distribute the Stixit pen in certain territories.\nDelvin J. held that the test whether the Court had jurisdiction to add as a defendant a person whom the plaintiff did not wish to sue, was whether the order for which the plaintiff was asking in the action might directly affect the intervener by curtailing the enjoyment of his legal rights. In that case, the plaintiff claimed that he was the owner, while the intervener alleged that he was the owner of the right, and  both disputes should be tried at the same time.\n12.        In the present case, there was a contest regarding title between the plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 3. The interveners set up a title challenging the title of both the plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 3. If the interveners have a title, the plaintiff's case for partition as against defendants 1 to 3 is liable to be rejected. The interveners directly claim a proprietary title in the subject-matter of the action. If their claim is accepted, then the decree to be passed in favour of the plaintiffs would be rendered infructuous unless the interveners are added as parties to the suit. The two tests laid down in ILR (1963) Cut 841 = (AIR 1963 Orissa 186) apply to this case, inasmuch as the plaintiffs claim relief as regards their title and no decree can be passed in their favour without affecting the rights of the interveners. In the absence of the interveners, any decree passed would ultimately become inexecutable as the interveners would not be bound by the decree unless they are impleaded as parties. The interveners also have a direct interest in the subject-matter of the action. Thus all the tests are applicable and the interveners should be impleaded as parties.\n13. Further, as was laid down in the Supreme Court case the question of addition of parties under\nOrder 1, Rule 10 C.P.C\n. is generally not one of initial jurisdiction of the court, but of judicial discretion which is to be exercised in view of the facts and circumstances of a particular case, though in some cases it may raise a controversy as to the power of the court in contradistinction to its inherent jurisdiction, or in other words, of jurisdiction in the limited sense in which, it is used in\nSection 115\nof the Code.\n14. For reasons analysed above, the learned Subordinate Judge did not exercise his jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. Neither was there improper exercise of discretion on his part.\n15. In the result, the civil revision fails and is dismissed, but in the circumstances without costs.",

Gupta\nBench:\nA.C. Gupta\nJUDGMENT\n\n \n\n P.N. Mookerjee, J.\n1. This appeal is by the plaintiffs and it arises out of a suit for partition, in which the plaintiffs made a claim for pre-emption under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act.\n2. The suit was instituted on March 20, 1957. The plaint was a simple plaint for partition on the allegation inter alia that the plaintiffs had l/3rd undivided share in the disputed property. Within two days, namely, on March 22, 1957, the plaintiffs applied for a temporary injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting structures on the suit land or changing its character and, in the said application, a reference was made to the\n\nplaintiffs' claim for pre-emption, or right in that behalf, -- under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act upon the ground that the defendant was a stranger purchaser, although he had purchased the major share, namely, 2/3rds, and, on the implication, though not very expressly stated, that the disputed property comprised the ancestral dwelling house of the plaintiffs' family. Thereafter, the suit proceeded for some time and, eventually, on September 22, 1959, there was a specific application for pre-emption under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act, mentioning all the requirements under the said section.\n3. The learned Trial Judge, after finding that the plaintiffs had l/3rd share in the disputed property and the defendant the remaining 2/3rds, made a preliminary decree for partition, and, upon the plaintiffs' above application under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act, came to the conclusion that, having regard to the nature of the disputed property and the circumstances of this case, it could be treated as coming sufficiently within the expression \"dwelling house belonging to undivided family\", as used in the said section, and, accordingly, the plaintiffs were entitled to pre-emption under the said statutory provision. In that view, he allowed the plaintiffs' said claim for pre-emption.\n4. On appeal, this decision was modified by disallowing the plaintiffs' claim under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act and giving them, in lieu thereof, only a decree for partition to be worked out in the ordinary way by a Commissioner by allotment of the disputed property to the parties in accordance with their shares, keeping in view their present possession.\n5. From this appellate decree, the present second appeal has been filed by the plaintiffs, who press their claim for pre-emption under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act and challenge the findings and the decision of the Lower Appellate Court on the point and ask for restoration of the Trial Court's decision in respect of the same.\n6. For the decision of this appeal, it will be convenient now to state, in brief, the relevant facts.\n7. The suit property originally belonged to one Satya Charan, who was the grandfather of the present plaintiffs. Satya Charan died, leaving three sons Gouri, Bimal and Nirmal, Plaintiffs are the sons of Gouri and are his heirs and legal representatives. On June 15, 1954, the plaintiffs appear to have sold their l/3rd share in the disputed property to their co-sharer, uncle Nirmal, who thus got 2/3rds share in the disputed property, l/3rd under this purchase and l/3rd originally by inheritance from Satya Charan. On March 19, 1955, the plaintiffs appear to have purchased, from co-sharers Bimal's heirs, their l/3rd interest in the disputed property, and, on August 4, 1956, Nirmal appears to have sold his above 2/3rds share of the disputed property to the defendant.\n8. The disputed property, as it now stands, comprises vacant land but it is well established that, upon this land, stood the original ancestral dwelling house of the plaintiffs' undivided family, or, in other words, that the disputed property was the site of that ancestral dwelling house. That house, along with the land underneath, forming its site, appears to have been requisitioned under the\nDefence of India Act\nby the military authorities, sometime in the year 1942, and it remained in their occupation until derequisition till about 1950. In the meantime, the structures on the said land, which had become dilapidated, were demolished by the military authorities and razed to the ground with the result that the site of the plaintiffs' ancestral dwelling house, or, more accurately, what was once the said dwelling house became vacant land. This was the state of the property, when the same was derequisitioned by the military authorities, and, thereafter, as we have seen above, there were certain transfers, which passed the title to undivided shares to the different parties, and, eventually, the plaintiffs became l/3rd owners of the same under the purchase from their co-sharers (Bimal's heirs) and the defendant obtained the remaining 2/3rds from the other co-sharer Nirmal.\n9. The principal question now is whether the disputed property can be held to be the dwelling house for purposes of the above statutory provision, namely,\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. Admittedly, there are no structures on the same at the present moment and there were never any at any time after 1950. The point is whether the absence or demolition of structures would alter the nature of the property, which was once the dwelling house of the family, and take it outside the purview or benefit of the above\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act.\n10. So far as this Court is concerned, the above statutory provision has almost always been liberally construed and widely interpreted in favour of the members of the family and strictly against the stranger purchaser. That will appear from all the relevant decisions, on the point, of this Court up till this time. Indeed, that is the view, which has been almost universally accepted in this Court and almost without demur at all times. Whether this rule of liberal construction and wide interpretation would have the effect of bringing the disputed property.\nwhich is now vacant land, within the meaning of \"dwelling house\", as used in the said section, is the principal mattes for consideration in this appeal.\n11. We may state here that, although the plaintiffs sold their original l/3rd share to another co-sharer Nirmal and thus became divested of any interest ton some time in the disputed property, they, by the acquisition of the l/3rd interest of co-sharer Bimal from his heirs in tha year 1955, that is, before the defendant's purchase and before the institution of the present suit, brought themselves within the category of persons, entitled to claim pre-emption under the above\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act (vide\nBotokrishna Ghose v. Akhoy Kumar Ghose\n).\n12. It is also well settled in this Court that the above statutory provision (\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act) applies not only in the case of a suit by the stranger purchaser as plaintiff but, also, to a case, where the said stranger purchaser is sued as a defendant for partition (vide\nAbu Isa Thakur v. Dinabandhu Banik\nand\nHaradhone Haldar v. Usha Charan Karmakar\n, 96 Cal LJ 168=(AIR 1953 Cal 292)).\n13. A point has been raised by Mr. Mitra, appearing on behalf of the defendant-respondent in this case, that that interpretation would be applicable or available, only where the defendant himself was claiming a share of the disputed property and not to a case, where the defendant's claim was, as in the instant case, that the property was not undivided joint property but had already been partitioned between the parties or their predecessors. This argument, however, having regard to the concurrent findings of the two Courts below that the defence of previous partition was unacceptable, cannot be accepted as a relevant distinction. The property, if it is really joint or undivided, would entitle the defendant (stranger purchaser) to his share, acquired by him by purchase, as aforesaid, --and he is actually claiming the same, --and so, the mere fact that he raised the defence of previous partition, which was ultimately negatived, would not alter the position. Indeed, in no view, can the stranger defendant be said to have given up or abandoned his claim to the purchased 2/3rds share or to a partition of the same, in case the property is held to be joint property of the parties, and, as a matter of fact, he has pressed for the same.\n14. We are, accordingly, of the view, that, provided the disputed property which, as we have said above, is vacant land at the present moment, can be treated as \"dwelling house\" within the meaning of the aforesaid statutory provision,\n\nthat provision would apply to the instant case to entitle the plaintiffs to their claim for pre-emption. Vide, in this connection, the authorities, already cited, and\nRamaswami Pillai v. Subramania Pillai\n.\n15. On the above material question, the position, as we have sufficiently indicated above, appears to be as follows:\nOn the vacant land in question, there was originally the ancestral dwelling house of the plaintiffs' family. During military requisition, the structures were demolished and the property was transformed to vacant land, The parties got possession in the year 1950 but, up till now, no structure has been built upon the same, although the plaintiffs claim that they had and have an intention of erecting their residence or dwelling house on it.\n16. In the kobala, by which the plaintiffs' share was sold to Nirmal, there was a recital that the same was being given to Nirmal, so that he may use it for purposes of the residence of his family, the plaintiffs' shifting elsewhere for purposes of their residence. The plaintiffs, thereafter, acquired Bimal's interest in the disputed property but it is not clear from the materials, now before us, including the kobala, by which the said purchase was made, for what purpose the same was acquired. It has been ruled by this Court in\nNil Kamal v. Kamakshya Charan\n. , that the mere fact that the structures on the disputed land, which was once the site of the family dwelling house of the parties, had disappeared, would not by itself, be conclusive on the point, whether it had ceased to be the dwelling house of the family. In\nthe said decision\nMukherji, J., laid down the relevant test in the following terms:\n\"The fact that the huts have blown down does not make the dwelling house any the less a dwelling house so long as the members have not abandoned it or, at any rate, given up the idea of using it as such.\"\nThat test seems to us to be a valuable and reasonable test, relevant and cogent on the point, and decisive on the question of the character of the property for purposes of the above statutory provision and It will be necessary to find out whether, in the instant case, that test is satisfied. This aspect of the matter, however, does not appear to have been appreciated or fully realised, either by the parties or by the Courts below, and, accordingly, sufficient materials on this point are not available on the present records.\n17. In the above view, we are unable to dispose of the matter finally now in this Court and the same will have to be\n\nremitted to the Lower Appellate Court for a decision on the said question on the materials, already on record and on such further materials as may be produced before it by the parties in support of their respective cases on the point.\n18. The view, we have taken above of the relative position in law and the view, we have taken of the decision, reported In  will be sufficiently, though not directly, supported by another decision of this Court, reported in\nKalipada Ghose v. Tulsidas Dutt , See\nalso , Supra.\n19. A more or less similar view appears also to have been taken by the Allahabad High Court in\nBhagirath v. Afaq Rasul\nalthough It may be pointed out that\nthe said decision\nmay be distinguishable from some points of view.\nThe decision of the Orissa High Court in\nBikal Swain v. Iswar Swain\n, no doubt supports the contrary, but in our opinion\n,\nthe said decision\ndid not take a correct and comprehensive view of the decision of this Court in the above cited case  and did not make the same liberal approach for the Section in question as has so often been stressed and recommended by this Court. We further feel that the broad view we have taken above, seems to be supported by the object and scheme of the section under consideration and its underlying spirit and purpose and the liberal approach and wide outlook, advocated by this Court almost on all occasions, whenever the said statutory provision came up for consideration, to solve difficulties and complications that would have otherwise arisen and remained outstanding, and that no other view would be consistent or in consonance with the same, remembering that this Court has almost as a rule, striven to apply the aforesaid section to preserve the integrity of the family dwelling house and to enable the members of the family to keep it for themselves as far as possible. We may also add that the relative observations in  are obiter and do not seriously affect the position.\n20. We would, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the decree of the Court of appeal below and send the matter back to the said Court for further consideration and for final disposal in the light of the observations, made in this judgment.\n21. Costs of this appeal will abide the final result of the suit.\nGupta, J.\n22. I agree.",

Mitra vs Kalipada Das And Ors. on 4 December, 1980\nEquivalent citations: AIR1981CAL278, AIR 1981 CALCUTTA 278, (1981) 1 CAL HN 524\nJUDGMENT\n \n\nB.C. Chakrabakti, J.\n1. These two appeals are directed against a common judgment disposing of Misc. Case No. 41 of 1962 and Misc. Case No. 10 of 1963 of the 6th Court of learned Subordinate Judge at Alipore.\n2. The two Misc. Cases arose out of two independent applications for pre-emption under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act arising out of Title Suit No. 34 of 1959 of the said Court.\n3. Sm. Panchanani Dasi defendant No. 4 in the said suit was the petitioner in Misc. Case No. 41 of 1962. The other Misc. Case No. 10 of 1963 was filed by Kalipada Das, defendant No. 3,\n4. The case of the two petitioners are practically identical. Their case is that the disputed properties namely premises No. 27/1A, Srish Chowdhury Lane, and 6A, Tarak Bose Lane form part of the same house and was the joint family dwelling house of Binodini Dasi and Tinkari Dasi. Binodini made a gift of her 8 annas shares in favour of Manmoth (the original plaintiff) who possessed the same jointly with his sisters, - Shyamasundari, Krishnabhamini, Durgabala and Panchanani. Shyamasundari, Krishnabhamini and Durgabala gifted away their 6 annas shares to the plaintiff and defendants Nos. 1 to 3 by a deed of gift dated 18-7-1957. Defendants Nos. 1 and 2 sold away their shares to the sons of defendant No. 4, while the plaintiff Manmoth Nath Das sold his 9 annas 6 paise share of the joint family dwelling house to Santosh Kumar Mitra on 27-4-62. The petitioner in Misc. Case No, 41 Panchanani Dasi and the petitioner in Misc. Case No. 10 of 1963 Kalipada Das prayed for purchasing the share transferred by the plaintiff to Santosh Kumar Mitra who was a stranger to the family, on payment of the consideration under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act.\n5. Santosh Kumar Mitra opposed both the cases. His contention in the Court below was that the disputed property was not the joint family dwelling house of Tinkari and Binodini or for the matter of that their successors, that they never lived in the suit premises which were all through Jet out to tenants and that the provisions of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act were not applicable to the case.\n6. Both parties adduced evidence. The learned Subordinate Judge upon a consideration of the evidence found that P. W. 1 Promotha Nath Das and defendant No. 3 Kalipada Das are living in the disputed house, that the disputed house is a dwelling house belonging to the undivided family and that the fact that the house was let out for more than 20 years was not a matter of much moment. On such findings the learned Subordinate Judge allowed Misc. Case No. 10 of 1963 arising out of the application of Kalipada Das. But with regard to the other Misc. case at the instance of Panchanani Dasi the learned Subordinate Judge found that she has been living at Entally since her marriage and ceased to be a member of the family. Tn that view of the matter the other Misc. case namely Misc. Case No. 41 of 1962 was dismissed on contest.\n7. Santosh Kumar Mitra and Panchanani Dasi preferred the present appeals, one against the order allowing the prayer of petitioner Kalipada Das and the other dismissing the prayer of Panchanani Dasi.\n8. Mr. Nirendra Krishan Milra appearing in support of the appellant Santosh Kumar Mitra urged two points in support of the appeal namely :\n(1) that\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act on its own terms is not applicable to the case and\n \n\n(2) that at any rate the property in dispute is not a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family.\n9.\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act provides that where a share of a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family has been transferred to a person who is not a member of such family and such transferee sues for partition, the Court shall, if any member of the family being a shareholder shall undertake to buy the share of such transferee, make a valuation of such share in such manner as it thinks fit and direct the sale of such share to such shareholder and may give all necessary and proper directions in that behalf. Let us assume for the present and assuming as such that the disputed property is a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family, it was argued that this section applies only where the transferee sues for partition and not otherwise. The object of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act is to preserve the integrity of the family dwelling house and to enable the members of the family to keep it for themselves as far as possible. In order to achieve this object the Courts have always preferred to put a liberal construction upon the\nPartition Act\nand to. interpret its provisions in such a way as would promote and fulfil the said object. In a suit for partition the question as to who is arrayed in the category of plaintiff and who in the category of the defendants is not of importance for a party in partition suit whether a plaintiff or a defendant is at the same time a plaintiff as well as a defendant (AIR 1949 Cal 245). Therefore the contention that\nSection 4\ncannot be attracted unless the transferee himself sues for partition does not seem to hold! good. In this particular case however the question has lost importance in view of the fact that the original plaintiff Monmoth Nath Das was the transferor from whom the appellant Santosh Kumar Mitra purchased a share of the dwelling house. Thereafter Santosh Kumar Mitra was substituted in place of Monmoth Nath Das. He is therefore transposed in the category of the plaintiff and he is certainly a person suing for partition. That being the position the first objection that Santosh Kumar Mitra not having sued for partition,\nSection 4\nwould have no application to this case, has no merits.\n10. The next point for consideration is whether the disputed property is a dwelling house of an undivided family as contemplated by\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. There is no dispute that the property in suit is a house property. There is also no dispute that it was originally in the occupation of the then owners Binodini and Tinkari. Subsequently -- it is not very clear from the evidence at that point of time -- the house was let out. There also is no dispute that one of the co-sharers namely Panchanani, since after her marriage has been residing elsewhere at Entally. The appellant Santosh Kumar Mitra who was a tenant and has since acquired a share in the property is a stranger to the family. The question is whether in such circumstances the property can be said to be a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family so as to attract the provisions of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act.\n11. P. W. 1, Promotha Nath Das is a brother of Panchanani. He says that the disputed house is the undivided dwelling house of the family, that during the war period the disputed house was let out and that for the last 7-8 years he has been living in the suit house along with Kalipada Das, another admitted co-sharer. P. W. 2 Diba-kar Bose is a neighbour. He says that the parents of Monmotho Nath Das and Kalipada Das lived in the disputed house and the marriage ceremonies of their sons and daughters took place there and that it was let out about 20 years ago. From the cross examination it appears that he has made some confusion about the period. But he is specific that it was used as a family dwelling house until it was let out. P. W. 3 is Panchanani Dasi, one of the applicants under\nSection 4\n. She says that the disputed property is their dwelling house, that she was married in that house and) her sons were also born there. On behalf of the opposite party Monmotho Nath Das says that the disputed house was let out to provide a source of income and that thereafter they moved to Gopalpur, never to return to the house. This was, according to the witness about 40 years ago. He also admits in cross-examination that Kalipada at present lives in the disputed house.\n12. From the evidence thus on record it follows that the disputed property certainly was at one time used as the dwelling house of the family and that the house was let out to tenants for a considerable period, the appellant Santosh Kr. Mitra being one of them and that two of the co-sharers have been in occupation of the house for some years before the litigation commenced. Since the house was not used as a dwelling house by the co-sharers for sometime it was argued on the authority of the case of Iqbal Uddin v. Ramnath, AIR 1935 All 894, that the house is not a dwelling house within the scope of\nSection 4\n. This was a case of a hut which was capable of being used as a dwelling house but not so used for a number of years -- not even at the time when the application under\nSection 4\nwas preferred. This decision however is in conflict with the view taken by our High Court.\n13. In the case of Manicklal v. Gouri Sankar, , the question arose in connection with a house property having two distinct blocks -- A and B. The owners lived in a portion of Block-B and let out the rest of Block-B and the whole of Block-A to tenants. In a suit for partition by a purchaser from one of the owners, the defendant applied for relief under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. It was -found that Block-A which was never used as a residential house and which was not necessary for the convenient user of Block-B was not a dwelling house, but that even the tenanted portion of Block-B was a part of the dwelling house.\n14. Another case (Durgapada v. Debi-das, ) was. referred to on behalf of the appellant, in support of his contention that in the facts and circumstances of the case the property could not be called a dwelling house. There the alleged dwelling house was situate in a village. The co-sharers who were separate in mess did not live there. Whenever they used to come to the village from different places for purpose of collection of paddy and for attending Kalipuja held in the adjoining plot, they used to stay in the property. It was held that the property could not represent a dwelling house. The reason behind the decision was that a dwelling house connotes to some extent a permanent abode of the undivided family where such family resides or intends to reside generally and not a house intended for a stray or temporary residence for a specified purpose.\n15. In a single Bench decision of this Court in the case of Mohinddin Molla v. Jitendra Nath, , it was observed that even if at the time of institution of the suit there is one member of the undivided family having any interest in the suit property which is the dwelling house of the undivided family, he shall have the right to file an application under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. In the instant case before us there is clear evidence that Kalipada Das has been residing in the house for 7-8 yenrs before 1964 when he was examined as a witness. This takes us to a period prior to the purchase by the appellant Santosh Kr. Mitra. Therefore there can be no doubt that he has a right to file an application under\nSection 4\n.\n16. In the case of Botokrishna v. Akshoy Kumar, , the expression 'undivided family' has been interpreted to mean a family not divided qua the dwelling house; the emphasis is on the undivided character of the house and it is this attribute of the house which imparts to the family, its character of an undivided family. So long as the dwelling house has not been completely alienated to a stranger, the actual position is that it is still an undivided family house, the possession and enjoyment of which are conferred on the members of the family (see Monomohan v. Usha-rani, ). In the case before us there is no dispute that the members of the family did not separate and were not divided qua the dwelling house. Consequently it seems that a member of such family is entitled to ask for relief under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act.\n17. The only point on which the claim is sought to be resisted js that a part of the house, may be a considerable part of it has been let out to tenants. The question is whether this amounts to cessation of the house being a family dwelling house.\nIn the case of\nDulal Chandra v. Gosthabehari\n, , it was observed that any suspension of occupation or for the matter of that, the absence of the owners of the house therefrom or an occupation or terminable occupation by tenants, cannot have the effect of making the house ceasing to be a dwelling house.\nIn the case of Satyendu v. Amarnath, , a Division Bench of this Court has held that the mere fact that a major part of the house was let out to tenants did not prima facie take the case put of the operation of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. Relying on these decisions we may justifiably hold that the fact that the premises was let out to tenants by itself is inconsequential unless it can be shown that it was so let out by the owners with the intention of never returning to it or using it as a residential house. From the evidence on record such an intention cannot be spelt out. On the other hand, it will bear repetition that some of the cosharers have come back to reside in the house. The intention to use the house as dwelling house is an important criterion in determining whether a house continues to be a dwelling house of the family or not. In the case of Bhagirath v. Afaq Rasul, , it was observed that even though the house may fall into a state of complete disrepair and not actually in use as a dwelling house, it will nevertheless continue to be a family residential house if the members of the family intend to use it as such as soon as they can conveniently do so.\n18. All these tests are satisfied in this case and we do not see why the claim of Kalipada Das for relief under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act should not be ailowed.\n19. As regards Panchanani Dasi the learned Subordinate Judge has found against her relying upon a decision of the Bombay High Court (AIR 1936 Bom 197). This decision lays down that a female of an undivided family marrying and going to live in her husband's house prima facie gives up her intention of residing in the old house belonging to the family and being married is also no longer a member of the family and as such is not entitled to the benefit of\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act. We have already indicated that undivided family has been used in\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act to mean a family not divided qua the dwelling house. It does not mean a joint family as commonly understood. Therefore from the fact that one of the cosharers being married has been residing in her husband's house, it does not follow that she has lost her right to claim relief since the  dwelling  house remains undivided of which she is a cosharer. The Bombay case  relied on by the  learned Subordinate Judge  came  to be considered in the case of\nRukia Bi v. Rajia Bibi\n, and the view taken in the Bombay case was dissented from.    This    was a case where reliefs were    sought    for    by a Mohammedan female marrying into another family.    It was held that under\nSection 4\nit is not  necessary  that  the  cosharer  applying for relief should continue to be a    member of the family.    Where therefore,    there    is no doubt that the house is a family dwelling house and that the petitioner is a cosharer who is entitled to a share in that house on partition   even   though   married     and     living in her husband's house would be entitled to maintain an application under\nSection    4\nof the Partition Act.\nIn  the case before    us    the claim of Panchanani Dasi cannot be defeat-ed in view of the decision in the    Bombay case.    Apart from  anything  else that was a case before the commencement of the\nHindu Succession Act\n.      The   position    of    Hindu female  even though married    into    another family has  since considerably changed    and she is entitled to claim relief on partition of the dwelling house.    The view expressed by the Bombay High Court in the case relied on by the learned Subordinate Judge came to be considered by  this  High Court also    in the case  of Salyendu  v.  Amarnath   (supra) but the view was found unacceptable.     In  that   view   of  the   matter we are unable to sustain the order of dismissal passed in  Misc.  Case No. 41  of   1962    filed at the instance of Panchanani    Dasi.      Her claim is sustainable in law and consequently her application also must succeed.\n20. The position therefore now is that two of the cosharers namely Kalipada Das and Panchanani Dasi have severally applied for leave to buy and the claim of both is sustainable. In that view of the matter Appeal No. 237 of 1964 arising out of Misc. Case No. 10 of 1963 is dismissed and the Appeal No. 553 of 1964 arising out of Misc. Case No. 41 of 1962 is allowed. Both* Panchanani and Kalipada having succeeded in establishing their right to relief under\nSection 4\nof the Partition Act, the learned Court below should now proceed according to the procedure laid down in Sub-section (2) of\nSection 3\nof the Partition Act The appeals are thus disposed of. There will be no order for costs.\nPreparation of formal decree   in   the ap- peals is dispensed with.\nLet this order along with the    records be sent down to the Court below forthwith.\nAnil K. Sen, J.\n21. I agree.",
