This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same. He has further stated that the suit has been filed for\nnullifying the sale deeds executed by Jayesh Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh and others. During his cross-examination, he has stated that he is a\nresident of Hatia, Chainpur; he has got no property in Kanderbera where\nthe suit property is situated; he was unable to give the Khata number and\nplot number of the suit property ; he had not seen any documents in\nconnection with the property; he could not say the boundary of the property;\nthe rent was being paid with respect to the disputed property, but he has not\nseen the rent receipt; he does not know as to how much paddy is grown on\nthe property, however, he has stated that he used to cultivate the land.\nHe further stated that he had not seen Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knows\nHari Narayan Parikh; he does not know Govindji B. Thakkar. He has also\ndenied having known other family members. He has simply stated that he\nknows Piyush and Prakash. At the time of measurement by Amin, he was\npresent but no document was prepared and he did not sign any document;\nhe has stated that he does not know Jayesh and Hemant and he does not\nknow the name of defendants. He could not say as to by whom and how the\ndisputed property was acquired. He was not able to give the details of the\nneighbourhood of the property. He did not know that the property was\npurchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and whether\nthey used to pay rent to the government. He could not say that after death\nof Manikant G. Thakkar, half portion of the suit property devolved upon his\nsons and daughters. He also could not say that the two daughters and the\n36\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntwo sons of Manikant G. Thakkar together sold the property by virtue of\nregistered deed dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7\nand that they came in possession of the property and got their name mutated\nand had been paying rent. He had also no idea that Hari Narayan Parikh had\nhalf share of the property which he also sold vide registered deed dated\n20.10.2012.\n53.   So far as P.W. 2 (Gayaram Singh) is concerned, he has stated that in\nthe family partition, half share of the disputed property was allocated to\nIndulal G. Thakkar, when he was alive and subsequently it devolved upon\nhis family members, who were in possession of the property. The family\npartition had taken place in the year 1973. He has stated that he has been\nworking on the property and the property was in possession of the plaintiffs.\nHe further deposed that suddenly in March 2012, the plaintiffs came to\nknow that defendant nos.1 to 4 appointed power of attorney defendant no.5,\nwho has sold portion of the property to defendant nos.6 and 7 and\ndefendants nos.6 and 7 got the property mutated in their name. Thereafter,\nthe plaintiffs raised objection before the Circle Officer. He also deposed\nthat in the year 2013, the plaintiffs came to know that defendant no.8 had\nsold some portion of the property to defendant no.9 although defendant no.8\nhad no right to sell the property. He asserted that defendant nos.1 to 4 and\ndefendant no.8 sold the property in illegal manner in spite of knowing that\nthey have no right, title and interest over the suit property. He asserted that\nthe plaintiffs have been in continuous possession of the property and the\nsale deed executed in favour of the defendant nos.6 and 7 and defendant\nno.9 is illegal and consequently the suit was filed for setting aside the sale\ndeed. This witness has also been cross-examined. During cross-\nexamination he stated that he is the resident of Kanderbera and has ancestral\nproperty but could not give the details of his property nor could he give the\ndetails of the disputed property; He stated that he has heard of Khata\nNo.102 but had not seen it; He has stated that he had not seen Manikant G.\nThakkar; the plaintiffs have filed case against the defendants but he does\nnot know their name; Indulal G. Thakkar had expired and he had not seen\nany paper other than the plaint. He has also stated that Yashomati (Plaintiff\nno.1) had told him that he has to go for deposing in the court. He has stated\n37\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthat he had heard the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh but had not seen them and that Hari Narayan Parikh had expired and\nhis two sons are Piyush and Prashant; his wife had also expired. He had not\nseen the father of Manikant G. Thakkar and has no idea as to how many\nbrothers were Manikant G. Thakkar. He is not aware as to how the disputed\nproperty was acquired by Manikant G. Thakkar. He had not been to the\nhouse of Manikant G. Thakkar nor he knew him. He has further stated that\nhe is not aware about the date of partition nor he has seen any document\nnor any partition had taken place in his presence. He is not aware as to\nwhich plot was allotted to whom during partition and the property was\nnever measured in his presence. He could not say that Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas alive and he was defendant no.8. He has stated that it was correct that\ndefendant Rahat Saeed Khan has constructed some house over the property\nand is carrying on business from the said property. He could not say the\ndate and month of construction of the house. The other property sold to\nMithila Motors is being occupied by them. During cross-examination by\ndefendant no.9, he stated that in the disputed property Hari Narayan Parikh\nhad made 8 rooms and was in possession of the same.\n54.   PW-3 is the Plaintiff No. 5, Mr. Piyush I. Thakkar, son of the late\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He has identified the suit land located in Kandarbera,\nThana No. 327, Khata No. 102, with a total area of 17.94 acres. He stated\nthat the Plaintiffs along with Defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and Proforma\nDefendants No. 10, 11, and 12, are all descendants of the late Govindji B.\nThakkar. The Principal Defendants are Defendants No. 5 to 9, who had no\nrelationship with Govindji Thakkar. While giving the genealogy, the said\ndefendant had stated that Govindji Thakkar had four sons, Manikant G.\nThakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar, Mukundlal G. Thakkar, and Chandrakant G.\nThakkar. After death, his property devolved upon his four sons. He stated\nthat on 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, along with one Hari Narayan\nParikh, purchased the suit land through registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n26.09.1959; the property was purchased from the joint family fund of\nManikant G. Thakkar, as he was the Karta of the family; the property was\nmutated jointly in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh; consequently, Manikant G. Thakkar was the owner of the half share\n38\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the property jointly with his three brothers; Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972; thereafter, his three brothers, his wife Savita Thakkar, and\nhis sons and daughters underwent a family partition as a consequence of\nwhich the property involved in the case fell in the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar who was in possession of the same and the plaintiffs continued to\nremain in possession of the property. He referred to earlier Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982 filed by Hari Narayan Parikh seeking declaration of his right,\ntitle and interest over the entire property covered by the sale deed dated\n26.09.1959; the suit was decreed by the judgment dated 30.05.1992. The\njudgment passed in the said title suit was subject matter of appeal in Title\nAppeal No. 10 of 1992, in which the plaintiffs were also included. He\nfurther stated that in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the wife of Manikant G.\nThakkar and his son Jayesh M. Thakkar deposed that the half share of the\ndisputed property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in family partition.\nThe Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was allowed, and the judgment and decree\nwere set aside, and it was held that Hari Narayan Parikh was entitled only\nto half share of the property. Against the judgment, Hari Narayan Parikh\nfiled Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R), which was also dismissed. He\nasserted that thereafter the plaintiffs continued to remain in possession of\nthe property. He deposed that suddenly in the year 2011, the defendant nos.\n1 and 2 filed application before the Circle Officer for demarcation of land\nupon which the plaintiffs objected, but in spite of that, demarcation was\ndone in Demarcation Case No. 43 of 2011-2012, wherein Hari Narayan\nParikh gave in writing that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year\n1973, the half share of the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar in\nfamily arrangement . The order passed in the demarcation case was\nchallenged before the High Court in CWJC No.1354 of 2012, which was\ndismissed against which LPA No. 310 of 2012 was filed, but the same was\nalso dismissed with observation.

Thakkar was made\n43\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nparty in the suit; he is aware that in the suit, half share each was declared in\nfavour of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has denied\nthe suggestion that the descendants of Manikant G. Thakkar did not have\nthe right to sell the property because Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund of all the brothers. He has denied that\nthe plaintiffs were having right, title, interest and possession with respect to\nthe property.\n57.   So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he is Gulab Chandra Manjhi.

Thakkar nor he knows the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar\nor their children. He has no idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from joint family fund. He has no idea as to whether there was\nany family partition amongst them nor he is aware that the property came\nin share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This witness has clearly denied that Indulal\nG. Thakkar or their children ever came in possession of the property and he\nstated that there has been no suit between Manikant G. Thakkar and Indulal\nG. Thakkar. He is not aware of the civil suit fought between Manikant G.\nThakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. He has stated that it is not correct to say\nthat Manikant G. Thakkar and his children did not have the right, title,\ninterest and possession to sell the property or that the property was\npurchased from the joint family fund of Manikant G. Thakkar and his\nbrothers.\n58.   So far as D.W. 3 is concerned, he is the defendant no. 6 in the present\ncase. He has fully supported the case of the defendants. He has stated that\nthe entire property was jointly purchased by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G. Thakkar who were in possession of the property and in\nrevisional survey settlement, the property stood recorded under Khata No.\n102 in joint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar;\n44\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nManikant G. Thakkar died leaving behind his wife, 2 sons and 2 daughters\nand the remaining half of the property was of Hari Narayan Parikh; after\ndeath of Manikant G. Thakkar his legal heirs and successors divided the\nproperty with Hari Narayan Parikh and remained in separate possession of\nhalf share of the property. He has given the details of the property which\nfell in the share of Manikant G. Thakkar which is having a total area of 8.97\nacres. After death of wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, the property devolved\nupon two sons and 2 daughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and they used to\ngrow paddy in a portion and in another portion, there were mango trees and\nin the remaining portion, they used to grow vegetables and they were in\npossession of the property; they executed power of attorney and sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through registered sale-deed no. 687\ndated 06.03.2012 for a consideration amount of Rs. 30 lakhs and thereafter,\nthe defendant nos. 6 and 7 came in possession of the property, got the\nproperty mutated through Mutation Case No. 2446 of 2011-12 and have\nbeen paying rent and their name has also been recorded in Jamabandi\nRegister (part-2). He has also stated that the property so purchased is in 3\nparts, but they are adjoining to each other. He has stated that in a portion he\nhas constructed a house and has given the description of the house and has\nalso got a hand pump over the property and has been growing mango, paddy\nand vegetable on the property. He has stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from his own source of income and not from the\njoint family fund and the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did\nnot ever have right, title and interest or possession over the suit property.\nHe has categorically stated that it is completely false to say that the property\nwas purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and the\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar during family partition. He\nhas asserted that the property was purchased from the own income of\nManikant G. Thakkar and was his self-acquired property. The remaining\nhalf share of the property which fell in the share of Hari Narayan Parikh\nwas also sold by registered deed to defendant no. 9. He has further stated\nthat Hari Narayan Parikh wrongly claimed right, title, interest and\npossession over the entire suit property. He has further stated that at the\ntime of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor and his wife\n45\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas not educated and was a housewife. She used to remain in distress for\nmaintenance of herself and her children and she used to trust Prakash I.\nThakkar who wrongly advised her and prepared false document and made\nthem party at the appellate Court. He has stated that the property never came\nin possession of Indulal G. Thakkar nor any document regarding family\npartition was made and if there is any such document, the same is forged\nand fabricated. This witness has further stated that he has also filed the\ncertified copy of the sale-deed which is a public document. He has also\nexhibited the registered power of attorney dated 23.11.2011 and asserted\nthat it is a public document. He has exhibited the certified copy of the\ncorrection slip in connection with Khata No. 102 as Exhibit- C and D. He\nhas exhibited different rent receipts of each year from the year 2012-13\nonwards. He has also exhibited the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board in his name and has asserted that he has right, title, interest\nand possession with respect to the suit property.\nD.W. -3 has been duly cross-examined and in his cross-examination, he has\nstated that he is not aware as to how many brothers Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad. He has denied that the property was purchased from the joint family\nfund of brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and that the property was jointly\nin the possession of Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers. He has denied\nthat there was ever any family partition amongst the brothers of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and the property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar. He has\nstated that there was a partition between Hari Narayan Parikh and\ndescendants of Manikant G. Thakkar and the descendants of Manikant G.\nThakkar got 8 acres and 97 decimals of land.

He has given the boundary of the property and denied that the\nplaintiffs have been forcibly removed from the property.\n59.   D.W. 4 is Md. Naushad. He has exhibited the rent receipts of the year\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 and he has also exhibited\n46\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nthe receipts dated 06.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board. This witness has also been cross-examined and he has\nfully supported the case of the defendants and he has given names of the\nofficers who had issued the receipts and were posted at the relevant point\nof time.\n60.   Numerous documents as exhibited by both the parties have been\nalready mentioned above. The most important documents for the purposes\nof this case are the judgement passed in the earlier suit, the appellate court's\njudgement (exhibit-22) which attained finality and also the stand taken by\nthe widow and children of Manikant G. Thakkar and their evidences\n(exhibit-20 and 20/1 in this case) in the earlier title suit which was fought\nbetween Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar which\nhas been heavily relied upon by the respondents (plaintiffs) to submit that\nthere was admission of family settlement vide exhibit-C in the earlier case\n(exhibit-16 in the present case) and allocation of the suit property was made\nto the exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the brother of Manikant G.\nThakkar. The second appeal against the appellate court's judgement was\nalso dismissed.\n61.   The Exhibit- 22 is the judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992 arising out of the judgment dated 30.05.1992 passed in earlier Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982 fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh whereby the suit was decreed in favour of Hari\nNarayan Parikh declaring that the entire suit property was the exclusive\nproperty of Hari Narayan Parikh although it was purchased in joint name\nof Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and the same property\nis the schedule A property in the present case . In the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 some of the issues which were framed and are relevant for the present\ncase are: -\n\"7. Was the suit property acquired by joint family of Manikant\n      G. Thakkar along with the plaintiff?\n8. Was consideration money for purchase of the suit property\n      was paid by the plaintiff alone and has joint family of the Mani\n      Kant G. Thakkar acquired any right over the property in\n      question?\n47\n2025:JHHC:14099\n9. Is the plaintiff sole owner of the property in suit?\n10. Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",

No. 9      : Mr. Amitabh Prasad, Advocate\n---\nLastly heard on 25/02/2025\n\n14/08.05.2025\n1.    This appeal has been filed by defendant nos. 6 and 7 of the suit\n            against the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree signed on\n            13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Chandil in\n            Title Suit No. 13 of 2014 whereby the suit has been partly decreed and the\n            registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed by defendant no. 5\n            (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos. 1 to 4- the legal heirs of late\n            Manikant G. Thakkar ) in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 has been set-\n            aside. The other sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 executed by the\n            defendant no.8 in favour of the Defendant no.9 was held to be valid.\n2.    The appellants were the defendant nos. 6 and 7 in the Title Suit No.\n            13 of 2014. The present respondent nos. 1 to 4 were the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5\n            before the learned trial Court. The plaintiff no.1 was the mother of the\n            plaintiff no. 2 to 5 and her name was deleted on account of her death. The\n            appellants are only concerned with registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n2\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n06.03.2012 executed by defendant no.5 being the power of attorney holder\nof defendant no. 1 to 4 in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 (the\nappellants).\n3.     Case of the plaintiffs\n  I.   The plaintiffs filed the suit for declaration of their right, title and\n       interest over half portion of the schedule-A land and they also prayed\n       for confirmation of their possession over the suit land. The plaintiffs\n       had also prayed for declaration of sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n       and sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 as null and void.\n II.   The suit land was measuring 17.94 acres situated at mouza\n       Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and described in schedule-A to the plaint.\n       The plaintiffs and the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and 8 and also the\n       proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 are Hindus and in matters of\n       inheritance and succession, they are guided by\nHindu Succession\n       Act, 1956\nhaving common ancestor namely, Govindji B. Thakkar\n       who died leaving behind his four sons Manikant G. Thakkar,\n       Mukundlal G. Thakkar, Indulal G. Thakkar and Chandrakant G.\n       Thakkar. Said Govindji B. Thakkar acquired several immovable\n       properties in the town of Jamshedpur and after his death his four sons\n       jointly inherited the same.\nIII.   On 26.05.1959, Manikant G. Thakkar, being karta of the joint Hindu\n       family, purchased the Schedule-A land along with the defendant no.\n       8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh in equal share by a registered sale-\n       deed from its previous owner which was also recorded in the name\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh in the last\n       Revisional Survey.\nIV.    Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers jointly possessed\n       the half portion of the schedule-A land by mutual arrangement with\n       Hari Narayan Parikh although there was no partition by metes and\n       bounds.\nV.     After death of Manikant G. Thakkar in the year 1972, there was\n       family partition of joint family properties among the 3 brothers of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and daughters of\n       Manikant G. Thakkar. In the said family partition, half portion of the\n3\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        schedule-A land was allotted in the share of the father of plaintiff\n        nos. 2 to 5 namely, Indulal G. Thakkar and after his death, the\n        plaintiffs came in possession of the same.\nVI.    Earlier, a title suit being Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was filed by the\n        defendant no. 8 - Hari Narayan Parikh before the Court of Sub-\n        ordinate Judge claiming the entire schedule-A land. It was his case\n        in the said title suit that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did\n        not pay the consideration amount of the land and therefore, he had\n        relinquished his share in favour of the defendant no. 8. The said suit\n        was instituted against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and the same\n        was decreed vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 in favour of the\n        plaintiff of the said title suit i.e. Hari Narayan Parikh. The decree\n        passed in the said title suit was challenged by the defendant nos. 1 to\n        4 of the said suit in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 before the District\n        Judge, West Singhbhum, Chaibasa which was later on transferred to\n        the Court of the 1st Additional District Judge, Seraikella.\nVII.    During the pendency of Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, the present\n        plaintiffs were added as co-appellants.\nVIII.   During trial of Title Suit No. 42 of 1982, the widow of Manikant G.\n        Thakkar had stated in her evidence that half portion of the schedule-\n        A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the family\n        partition which took place in the year 1973. Further, in the said title\n        suit, it was stated by defendant no. 1 of the present case that in the\n        family partition of the year 1973, half portion of the schedule-A land\n        was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nIX.    The said title appeal being Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992, wherein the\n        present plaintiffs were also the co-appellants, was decided vide\n        judgment dated 30th September 1999 and the judgment passed by the\n        learned trial court in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was set-aside. The\n        learned appellate Court declared that the present plaintiffs have got\n        right, title and interest over half of the scheduled land.\n  X.    The defendant no. 8 namely Hari Narayan Parikh filed appeal against\n        the said judgement passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 which was\n        registered as Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R). However, the said\n4\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        second appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree passed by\n        the learned 1st appellate Court was confirmed.\nXI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs in this case that the plaintiffs had been\n        coming in possession of the half portion of schedule-A land, but in\n        the year 2011, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition before the\n        Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of half portion of the\n        schedule-A land. The plaintiffs objected to the same but the Circle\n        Officer, Chandil passed the order of demarcation in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiffs challenged the order passed by\n        the Circle Officer before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1354 of 2012\n        which was dismissed and the LPA against the order passed in the writ\n        petition was also dismissed with observations vide order dated\n        28.08.2012.\nXII.    Further, in the month of March 2012, it came to the knowledge of the\n        plaintiffs that defendant nos. 6 and 7 had filed application for\n        mutation in respect of the land mentioned in schedule-B to the plaint\n        before the Circle Officer, Chandil on the strength of sale-deed no.\n        687 dated 06.03.2012 which was said to have been executed by\n        defendant no. 5 as attorney of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of\n        the defendant no. 6 and 7 (the present appellants) . The plaintiffs\n        objected to the said application for mutation and also claimed\n        mutation in their name, but the Circle Officer, Chandil did not\n        consider their prayer and allowed mutation in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7 (the present appellants).\nXIII.   Against the aforesaid order passed in favour of defendant nos. 6 and\n        7 by the Circle Officer, Chandil, the plaintiffs filed appeal being\n        Mutation Appeal No. 09 of 2012-13 before the Land Reforms Deputy\n        Collector, Chandil. Vide order dated 16.05.2013, the Land Reforms\n        Deputy Collector remanded the matter back to the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil for passing fresh order in the light of the documents of the\n        plaintiffs. Thereafter, a fresh order was passed by the Circle Officer,\n        Chandil and the mutation was again allowed in favour of defendant\n        nos. 6 and 7. The plaintiffs have again preferred appeal against the\n5\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        order of the Circle Officer, Chandil which, as per the plaint, is still\n        pending.\nXIV.    With respect to remaining half portion of schedule A property, it is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that in the year 2013, it came to the\n        knowledge of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8 also sold 8.97\n        acres of land out of the schedule-A land in favour of the defendant\n        no. 9 by executing registered sale deed no. 4324 on 20.10.2012. It is\n        the case of the plaintiffs that the defendant no. 8, without partition of\n        the schedule-A land by metes and bounds, could not have transferred\n        any portion of the suit land to a stranger and as such, the sale deed\n        no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 registered at Sub-Registry Office was null\n        and void and did not confer any right in favour of the defendant no.\n9.\n XV.    There was a title suit being Title Suit No. 8 of 1998 before the Civil\n        Court, Jamshedpur with regard to the properties of Govindjee B.\n        Thakkar and Manikant G. Thakkar among the heirs and in that suit\n        also, the other co-sharers admitted that after the death of Manikant\n        G. Thakkar there was family partition in the year 1973.\nXVI.    It is the case of the plaintiffs of this case that defendant nos. 1 to 4\n        were well-aware of the fact that the half portion of the schedule-A\n        land belonged to the plaintiffs which they admitted before the court\n        of law and in spite of that, their attempts to deprive the plaintiffs by\n        transferring half of the schedule land from their legitimate property\n        cast a cloud over the right, title and interest of the plaintiffs over half\n        portion of the schedule -A land, which led to filing of the present suit\n        by the plaintiffs.\nXVII.   As per the plaintiffs, the cause of action arose since November, 2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed petition for demarcation of the\n        suit land before the Circle Officer, Chandil and again on 23.11.2011\n        when the defendant nos. 1 to 4 executed a power of attorney in favour\n        of defendant no. 5. The cause of action also arose on 06.03.2012\n        when the defendant no. 5, being power of attorney holder, executed\n        registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 in favour of the\n        defendant nos. 6 and 7. Further, the cause of action also arose on\n6\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        20.10.2012 when the defendant no. 8 executed sale-deed no. 4324 in\n        favour of defendant no. 9.\nCase of the defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 and defendant nos. 3 and 4\n4.      The defendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 filed common written statement\non 29.09.2014. The defendant nos. 3 and 4 filed their separate common\nwritten statement and in both sets of written statements, common pleas were\ntaken. Case of the defendant nos. 1 to 7 before the learned trial Court was\nas under:\nA. The plaintiffs had no right or cause of action to sue the defendants.\n        The suit was not maintainable for the reliefs as claimed by the\n        plaintiffs. It was also asserted that the suit was barred by limitation,\n        and also barred under principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n        It was asserted that the suit was not properly affidavited and verified\n        as required under\nOrder XIX Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure\n. The\n        suit was bad for non-joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The\n        suit was not properly valued as required under law and the\n        description of the suit land was vague and incorrect. The suit was hit\n        under the provisions of civil Procedure Code, Specific Relief Act and\n        other Acts.\nB. It was stated, inter alia, that the entire land of 17.94 acres could not\n        be subject matter of the suit. It was further case of the defendants that\n        it was wrong to say that all brothers, i.e. all four sons of Late\n        Govindjee B. Thakkar were living jointly where the eldest brother\n        Manikant G. Thakkar, being the member of the joint Hindu Family,\n        was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nC. The land jointly purchased by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\n        Narayan Parikh was not purchased from the joint family fund of\n        Manikant G. Thakkar. It was also denied that Manikant G. Thakkar\n        and his 3 brothers jointly possessed the half portion of the schedule-\n        A land of the plaint by mutual arrangement with Hari Narayan Parikh\n- defendant no. 8.\nD. Manikant G. Thakkar along with Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no.\n        8] during his lifetime purchased the schedule-A land of the plaint in\n        their joint name by means of a registered sale deed no. 1777 dated\n7\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   26.09.1959 on valuable consideration of Rs. 10,000/-from its lawful\n   owner and since after purchase of the schedule-A land of the plaint,\n   the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar during his lifetime along with the\n   defendant no. 8 was in peaceful joint possession of the schedule - A\n   land of the plaint whose name has also been recorded jointly in\n   record-of-rights. It was further asserted that after death of Manikant\n   G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M. Thakkar (since deceased), two sons\n   Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1) and Hemant M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti M. Thakkar\n   (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa M.\n   Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\n   Thakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A\n   land and since then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over\n   their half undivided portion and share over the schedule-A land along\n   with said Hari Narayan Parikh.\nE. It was further case of the defendants that the aforesaid legal heirs and\n   successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being in need of money, jointly\n   sold their half portion and share of the schedule-A land to defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 through their\n   power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the defendant\n   nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\n   were paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing\n   their business over the said land.\nF. The further case of these defendants was that there was no any Family\n   Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n   the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever allotted and given\n   in the share of father of the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 (respondent nos. 1 to\n   4 herein) nor did he possess the said land till his death nor the\n   plaintiffs came in possession of the land at any point of time after the\n   death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nG. It was further case of the defendants that after death of Manikant G.\n   Thakkar, the widow of Manikant G. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M.\n   Thakkar on having trust and faith on plaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash\n8\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n   I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 against the\n   defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence along with her\n   son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their schedule-A\n   land from the hand of the defendant no. 8 who brought the said Title\n   Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there was\n   no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\n   scheduled land nor the half portion of the scheduled land was ever\n   allotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased\n   Manikant G. Thakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the\n   half portion of the schedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal\n   G. Thakkar nor the plaintiffs ever came in possession over the half\n   portion of the schedule-A land at any point of time.\nH. The vendors of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful,\n   continuous and regular possession over their half portion of the\n   schedule-A land for the last more than 30 years, who thereafter\n   transferred their half portion of the schedule-A land on valuable\n   consideration in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 and since then,\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 had been in continuous physical\n   possession over the land in question for more than 30 years.\nI. It was further asserted by these defendants that the plaintiffs neither\n   were in possession of the half portion of the Schedule-A land nor\n   they came in possession of the said half portion of the Schedule-A\n   land at any point of time, and when the plaintiffs failed to established\n   their possession and rights over the said half portion of the Schedule-\n   A land in Demarcation Case no.43/2011-12 before the Circle Officer,\n   Chandil on petition filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2, the Circle\n   Officer, Chandil passed order for demarcation of the land and\n   deputed Anchal Amin for the Demarcation of the Schedule-A land\n   and its partition in two equal shares. When the Anchal Amin visited\n   the spot of the Schedule-A land for its demarcation, neither the\n   Plaintiffs nor their any person or party came forward for objecting\n   the demarcation process at the spot of the Schedule-A land and\n   therefore, the Anchal Amin after completing the demarcation of the\n   Schedule-A land submitted his report.\n9\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nJ. After demarcation of the Schedule-A land, the eastern half portion\n   was kept by defendant No.8 Hari Narayan Parikh and the Western\n   half portion was allotted and given in the share and portion of the\n   heirs of the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar, the defendant No.1 to 4\n   who thereafter negotiated for the sale of their western half portion of\n   the Schedule-A land with defendant Nos.6 & 7 and on receipt of its\n   full   and   final   consideration, they         transferred their share\n   and     portion      of     western       half     of     the     schedule-\nA land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their lawful\n   Attorney - the defendant no.5 and put them in possession who have\n   been in peaceful joint possession and by mutating their said land in\n   their joint name paying the rent to Govt. of Jharkhand through C. O.,\n   Chandil and also doing their business over their portion of land by\n   taking Electricity Line from the Jharkhand State Electricity Board,\n   Chandil.\nK. It was further case of these defendants that it was wrong to say that\n   the plaintiffs were not aware about the transfer of the half portion of\n   the schedule-A land by defendant No.1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 & 7,\n   but only to harass the defendants for their wrongful gain, the\n   plaintiffs without having any right, title, interest and possession over\n   the said half portion of the schedule-A land had objected the\n   Mutation Application of the defendant no.6 & 7 and without any\n   right, title and interest over the said half portion of the schedule-A\n   land claimed the Mutation of the said land in their name after passing\n   of more than 12 years.\nL. The plaintiffs preferred Appeal No.9/2012-13 against the order of the\n   C.O., Chandil in Mutation Case no. 2446/2011-12 and the learned\n   Land Reforms Deputy Collector remanded back the Mutation case to\n   C.O., Chandil to pass a fresh order. On receipt of the record and order\n   of L.R. D. C., Chandil, the circle officer re-heard the matter afresh,\n   but the plaintiffs again failed to establish their right, title, interest and\n   even possession over the said half portion of the Schedule-A land and\n   the Circle Officer, Chandil rightly allowed the Mutation in favour of\n   the defendant nos. 6 and 7 afresh.\n10\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n     M. It was further asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights, title, interest\n         or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land at\n         any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of\n         the deceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half\n         portion of the Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G.\n         Thakkar and who being lawful owner having all rights, title, interest\n         and possession over the half portion of Schedule-A land rightly\n         transferred their half portion and share of schedule-A land in favour\n         of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their lawful Attorney defendant\n         No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally false, incorrect and\n         wrong.\nN. It was also the case of these defendants that no cause of action arose\n         against the defendants either on November 2011 or 23.11.2011 or on\n         06.03.2012, or on any date or dates as has been alleged by the\n         plaintiffs in para 28 of the plaint and the plaintiffs for their wrongful\n         gain brough the suit after passing more than 12 years on the basis of\n         some false and concocted stories.\nO. It was accordingly submitted that the plaintiffs' claim was false,\n         fabricated and wrong and the plaintiffs had got no merit and hence\n         the suit was liable for dismissal with exemplary cost.\nCase of the defendant nos. 8 and 9\n5.       The written statement on behalf of the defendant no. 9 was filed by\none of its employees namely, Shivdut Sharma. Further, a separate written\nstatement was filed by defendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh.\nHowever, in both the written statements identical pleas were taken and\nfollowing stand was taken by both the defendants in their written statement:\nI. The suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable and there was no\n         cause of action or right to bring the suit against the defendants. The\n         suit was barred by limitation, estoppel, waiver and acquiescence.\n         The suit was barred under the provisions of Specific Relief Act,\n         Hindu Law and Hindu Succession Act. The suit was stated to be\n         barred under the provisions of\nTransfer of Property Act\nand Civil\n         Procedure Code. The suit was bad for non-joinder of necessary\n         parties and mis-joinder of parties. The defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12\n11\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       were wrongly made proforma respondents and as per the defendant\n       nos.8 and 9, they should have joined as plaintiffs and in absence of\n       them as party plaintiffs to the suit, the suit could not have proceeded.\n       It was also asserted that other descendants of late Govindjee B.\n       Thakkar were also necessary parties to the suit and in their absence\n       also, the suit could not have proceeded. The plaintiffs, in order to\n       avoid to make them parties, did not disclose the genealogy of late\n       Govindjee B. Thakkar.\nII. The plaintiffs' claim of confirmation of possession of half portion of\n       schedule-A land was vague and unless plaintiffs claimed\n       confirmation of possession and/or recovery of possession of the\n       specified half portion of schedule -A land, the suit was liable to be\n       dismissed on that score.\nIII. The defendant nos.8 and 9 denied all the allegations made in the\n       plaint save and except those which were specifically admitted in\n       their written statement.\nIV. The description of the suit land as given in the schedule 'A', 'B' and\n       'C' of the plaint was incorrect.\nIn schedule 'B' land, the defendant no.6 and 7 had constructed a big\n       hall/Shed which was very much in existence. Similarly in the\n       schedule 'C' there were 10 asbestos roofed rooms in existence. The\n       plaintiffs purposely avoided to mention existence of structures.\n V. The parties mentioned in para 2 of the plaint are guided by\n       Mitakshara School of Hindu Law as such all the descendants of Late\n       Govind G. Thakkar as well as Indulal G. Thakkar were necessary\n       parties to the suit.\nVI. As per their information, there was no joint family nor there was any\n       joint family fund. It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar was the\n       Karta of the joint family and that out of joint family fund he\n       purchased schedule \"A' land alongwith defendant no.8. However, it\n       was asserted that Manikant G. Thakkar purchased schedule 'A' land\n       alongwith defendant no.8 in equal share from the previous owner.\nVII.   It was denied that Manikant G. Thakkar and his other three brothers\n       jointly possessed half portion of schedule 'A' land. It was the case of\n12\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n       the defendant nos.8 and 9 that only Manikant G. Thakkar was in\n       possession of the schedule 'A' land and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of half portion of schedule 'A' land as per arrangement\n       arrived at by them, during the life time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nVIII. The schedule 'A' land was the joint property of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and defendant no.8. After purchase of the suit property, an\n       arrangement was arrived at mutually between Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8 and in the said arrangement Manikant G.\n       Thakkar was allotted a definite half portion of the property of which\n       he came in exclusive possession after the said arrangement and\n       continued to possess the same till his death. Similarly, the defendant\n       no.8 was allotted a definite half portion of the schedule 'A' land of\n       which he came in possession and continued to remain in exclusive\n       possession, till he transferred the same in favour of the defendant no.\n9. It was the case of the defendant nos.8 and 9 that the above\n       arrangement amounted to complete partition of schedule 'A' land\n       between the said two parties.\nIX. The defendant no.8 constructed several rooms with asbestos roof in\n       the portion allotted to his share which was given to Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra to run their activities. A few years back only Gramin Bikash\n       Kendra vacated the rooms, which in course of time became very\n       much damaged.\nX. The aforesaid half portion of the schedule\" A' land allotted to the\n       share of Manikant G. Thakkar in the aforesaid arrangement arrived\n       at between Manikant G. Thakkar and defendant no.8 was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar till his death and after the death\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar, the same came in possession of his legal\n       heirs and successors.\nXI. Indulal G. Thakkar never came in possession of the said half share of\n       schedule 'A' land or any portion of schedule 'A' land nor after his\n       death his legal heirs including the plaintiffs came in possession of\n       the said portion of schedule 'A' land nor they were in possession of\n       the same.\n13\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXII. Manikant G. Thakkar had dues of huge amount payable to the income\n       tax recovery tribunal in which the entire schedule 'A' property was\n       attached and in order to avoid attachment and auction sale of the said\n       property for recovery of the dues by taxation department, the heirs\n       of Manikant G. Thakkar in collusion and connivance with Indulal G.\n       Thakkar came forward with the false story of partition and allotment\n       of half share of schedule 'A' property to Indulal G. Thakkar making\n       out a false case of partition in the year 1973, in fact there was no\n       partition in the year 1973 nor the half portion of schedule 'A' land\n       was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar.\nXIII. At the time of alleged partition said to have been made in the year\n       1973, the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar were in exclusive possession\n       of a definite half portion of schedule 'A' property which was in\n       possession of Manikant G. Thakkar having been allotted to his share\n       in the arrangement arrived at between Manikant G. Thakkar and\n       defendant no.8.\nXIV.   The defendant nos. 1 to 4 and their mother were in possession of the\n       schedule 'B' land which was in possession of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXV. In order to avoid confusion regarding identity of the portion in\n       possession of the respective parties i.e, heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar\n       and the defendant no.8, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 filed a petition\n       before the Circle Officer, Chandil for demarcation of the respective\n       portion and there was no merit in the objection raised by the\n       plaintiffs against demarcation before the Circle Officer, Chandil,\n       therefore, the Circle Officer rightly rejected the objection of the\n       plaintiffs objecting application for demarcation filed by the\n       defendant nos. 1 & 2. The demarcation was made according to the\n       separate possession of the respective parties i.e., heirs of Manikant\n       G. Thakkar and defendant no.8.\nXVI. The plaintiffs had full knowledge that the defendant no.6 and 7 had\n       purchased the portion of the land, which was in share and in\n       possession of the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through Manikant G.\n       Thakkar. The plaintiffs also had full knowledge that immediately\n       after purchase on 06.03.2012 the defendant no.6 and 7 came in\n14\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         peaceful physical possession of the same without any obstruction\n         and objection by the plaintiffs or any person. The defendant no.6 and\n         7 after coming in possession of the schedule 'B' land on the basis of\n         said purchase made by them filed an application for mutation of their\n         names in the office of Circle Officer, Chandil with respect to their\n         said purchased land. After obtaining report from the Anchal Amin,\n         the Circle Officer, Chandil passed an order on 26.03.2012 for\n         mutation of schedule 'B' land in the names of defendant no. 6 and 7.\n         By passing a reasoned order the Circle Officer, Chandil rejected the\n         objection raised by the plaintiffs for mutation.\nXVII. Mutation Appeal No. 9 of 2012-13 was wrongly filed by the plaintiffs\n         knowing fully well that they were not in possession of the land in\n         question and their objection to mutation was rightly rejected by the\n         Circle Officer.\nXVIII.   The order passed by learned L.R.D.C, Chandil in Mutation Appeal\n         No. 09 of 2012-13 remanding the case for fresh decision was not in\n         accordance with law, principle and guideline for mutation.\n XIX.    After remand the Circle Officer after considering the relevant\n         materials and also considering the observation of the appellate\n         authority, allowed the mutation in favour of the defendant nos. 6 and\n7. It was denied by defendant nos.8 and 9 that the Circle Officer had\n         completely overlooked the direction of the appellate authority i.e.\n         Land Reforms Deputy Collector.\nXX. The defendant no.8 was in exclusive separate possession of 8.97\n         acres of land since the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar which was\n         clearly demarcated in aforesaid Demarcation Case and was sold to\n         the defendant no.9 by registered sale deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012\n         and possession of the same was delivered to the defendant no.9.\n XXI. The defendant no.9, on coming in possession of the said land by\n         virtue of aforesaid purchase, filed an application for mutation of the\n         said land in its name vide mutation case no.407 of 2012-13. The\n         Circle Officer, Chandil allowed the application of mutation of\n         defendant no.9 with respect to the schedule 'C' land. The defendant\n         no.9 has been paying rent in its name since order of mutation. The\n15\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n         plaintiffs did not raise any objection at any stage of mutation. The\n         defendant no. 9 fenced the land partly by brick wall partly by\n         concrete pillars and partly by wire and also reconstructed about 10\n         rooms with asbestos roof.\nXXII. It has been incorrectly alleged that defendant no.8 without partition\n         of schedule A' land by metes and bounds with the plaintiffs could\n         not transfer any portion of the suit land to any stranger and the sale\n         deed no.4324 dated 20.10.2012 was null and void and that did not\n         confer any right in favour of the defendant no.9. The plaintiffs had\n         no right or possession over the schedule 'A' land nor it was required\n         by defendant nos. 8 to partition the schedule 'B' land with the\n         plaintiffs. It was crystal clear that the land was divided / partitioned\n         to two portions during the lifetime of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIII.   The plaintiffs did not have any legal right to challenge the validity of\n         said sale deed, since the defendant no. 8 had been in possession of\n         said 8.97 acres of land having legal right of the same from the life\n         time of Manikant G. Thakkar.\nXXIV. It was denied that the defendant no.8 could not have sold the said\n         land to the defendant no.9. The defendant no. 8 had right, title,\n         interest and possession over the schedule 'C' land and he had every\n         right to transfer the same to the defendant no. 9.\nXXV. The defendant nos.8 and 9 were not aware of the Title Suit No. 8 of\n         1998 and admission, if any, as alleged in the said title suit was not\n         binding on the defendant no.8 or the defendant no. 9.\nXXVI. It was denied that defendant no. 1 to 4 attempted to deprive the\n         plaintiffs by transferring half of the schedule 'A' land and the same\n         had cast a cloud over the title of plaintiffs over the schedule 'A' land.\n         The defendant nos. 1 to 4 were in possession of schedule 'B' land,\n         which was duly demarcated by circle officer and had been mutated\n         in their names.\nXXVII.   Defendant no.10 had no manner of right, title or interest over any\n         portion of schedule 'A' land therefore the allegation that the\n         defendant no.10 has separated himself from the plaintiffs in the year\n         1992 by taking his share in the paternal property as such have got no\n16\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n          right over the suit land was incorrect. The defendant no.10 had no\n          right over the suit land at any point of time.\nXXVIII.   The T.(P).S. No. 69 of 2012 was collusive and was filed with some\n          oblique motive for some wrongful gain. The same was not binding\n          on defendant no.8 or the defendant no.9.\nXXIX. The proforma defendant nos.11 and 12 did not have any manner of\n          right, title, interest or possession over any portion of schedule 'A'\n          land. They were wrongly made parties to the suit.\nXXX. It was further asserted on behalf of defendant nos.8 and 9 that the\n          plaintiffs were not entitled for a decree declaring their right, title,\n          interest over half portion of schedule 'A' land and confirmation of\n          their possession over the same. The said reliefs sought by the\n          plaintiffs were vague and indefinite. The plaintiffs were also not\n          entitled for a declaration that the sale deed no.687 dated 06.03.2012\n          executed by defendant no.5 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 is\n          null and void and did not confer any title in favour of defendant no.6\n          and 7 and for declaration that the sale deed no. 4324 dated\n          20.10.2012 executed by defendant no.8 in favour of defendant no.9\n          is null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n          defendant no.9.\nXXXI. The plaintiffs were also not entitled to a decree declaring that order\n          passed by concerned Circle Officer in mutation case no. 2446 of\n          2011-12 in favour of defendant no. 6 and 7 was illegal. The plaintiffs\n          were also not entitled for a decree for injunction restraining the\n          defendant no.9 and defendant nos.6 and 7 from coming over any\n          portion of schedule 'A' land.\nXXXII.    The defendant no.8 was in possession of the schedule 'C' land as\n          absolute owner thereof. The defendant no.9 purchased schedule `C`\n          land from defendant no.8 on payment of Rs. 3,05,00,000/- and came\n          in possession of the same and got its name mutated in the office of\n          Circle Officer, Chandil. The defendant no.9 has been in exclusive\n          possession of schedule 'C' land on payment of rent to the State\n          Government.\n17\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.    The plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the suit and\n             the suit was liable to be dismissed with cost.\n6.      Case of Proforma Defendant no. 10 ( full brother of plaintiff nos.\n   2 to 5)\n        A. Manikant G. Thakkar and his three brothers jointly possessed half\n           portion of the lands purchased by both Manikant G. Thakkar and\n           defendant no. 8 on the basis of mutual arrangement, although there\n           was no partition by metes and bounds amongst the heirs of Manikant\n           G. Thakkar and his three brothers.\nB. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was a family partition of\n           the joint family properties amongst the three brothers of Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, and wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Manikant G.\n           Thakkar on 16.02.1973 which was reduced into writing and signed\n           by them. In the aforesaid family partition, half portion of the schedule\n-A land was allotted in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar, the father of\n           defendant no. 10. However, the plaintiffs suppressed the fact that\n           after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the lands had been rented\n           out to Telco Gram Vikas Kendra by the defendant no. 8.\n           Subsequently, Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 filed by defendant no. 8\n           against the heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar for declaration of right,\n           title, interest and possession over the entire schedule -A land was\n           decided in favour of the defendant no. 8. However, the said order\n           passed in favour of defendant no.8 was set-aside in appeal.\n        C. The defendant nos. 1 and 2 being the sons of late Manikant G.\n           Thakkar, had got no right to submit application for demarcation in\n           view of the fact that the lands in question were allotted to Indulal G.\n           Thakkar in the family partition. The Circle Officer passed an\n           erroneous order for demarcation of the land on the prayer of\n           defendant nos. 1 and 2.\nD. The defendant no. 10 had filed Title (Partition) Suit No. 69 of 2012\n           against the plaintiff - Jasamati I. Thaker and others and in the said\n           suit the plaintiff claimed 1/8th share in the suit properties including\n           the present suit property at village - Kanderbera. The plaintiffs of the\n18\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n        present suit also appeared in that suit and written statement was also\n        filed by them.\nE. It was also stated by the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled to\n        his due share in the schedule-A property along with the plaintiffs.\n     F. It was denied that the defendant no. 10 had completely separated\n        himself from the family of the plaintiffs in the year 1992 by taking\n        his entire share in the paternal property. It was asserted that aforesaid\n        statement made in the plaint by the plaintiffs was baseless and such\n        statement was made only to deprive the defendant no. 10 of his due\n        share in the suit property and also to take defence in the Title (P) Suit\n        filed by defendant no. 10 at Jamshedpur Court. The defendant no.10\n        never got his due share in the paternal property earlier.\n     G. Proforma Defendant Nos. 11 and 12 who are daughters of late Indulal\n        G. Thakkar were also entitled to their due shares in the paternal\n        property in view of the provisions of\nHindu Succession Act, 1956\nwhich was amended in the year 2005.\nH. It was also the case of the defendant no. 10 that he was also entitled\n        to the relief as that of plaintiffs of the present suit keeping in view\n        the substantial interest in the suit property.\n7.      Case of Proforma Defendant nos. 11 and 12\n        Proforma defendant nos. 11 and 12 filed their written statement\nbefore the learned trial Court and almost all the pleas which were taken by\nthe proforma defendant no. 10 in his written statement were also taken by\nthese defendants and it was their case that they were also entitled to their\ndue share in the schedule- A property along with the plaintiffs of the present\ncase.\n8.      The learned trial Court framed following issues for consideration:\n1. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is maintainable in its\n            present form or not?\n2. Whether the plaintiffs have a proper cause of action to file\n            the suit or not?\n3. Whether the plaintiff's suit is appropriate for non-joinder\n            or mis-joinder of the parties or not?\n19\n2025:JHHC:14099\n4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the sale\n            deed No. 687 dated 06/03/12 executed by defendant No. 5 in\n            favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and void\n            or not?\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the sale deed No.\n            4324 executed by defendant No. 8 in favour of defendant\n            No. 9 declared null and void or not and also whether the\n            plaintiffs are entitled to get a permanent injunction against\n            the defendants or not? Whether the order passed by the\n            Circle Officer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No.\n            2446/11/12 should be declared null and void?\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get litigation expenses\n            in this suit?\n7. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get any other relief\n            from the court or not?\n8. Whether the plaintiffs have right, possession and title over\n            half of the disputed property and whether they are entitled\n            to get possession on half of the disputed property or not?\n9. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of res judicata or\n            not?\n10. Whether this suit is barred by the law of limitation or not?\n11. Whether this suit is barred by the rules of estoppel, waiver\n            acquiescence or not?\n9.      Before the learned trial Court, the plaintiffs adduced altogether 4\nwitnesses; P.W. 1: Raja Manjhi, P.W.2: Gayaram Singh, P.W.3: Piyush I.\nThakkar and P.W.4: Hemant I. Thakkar. A number of documentary\nevidences were also exhibited before the learned trial Court which are as\nunder:\n\"Exhibit-1, Legal Notice dated 23.09.2019\n     Exhibit-1/A.

D.W. 1:\nDeepak Sarkar, D.W. 2: Gulab Chandra Manjhi, D.W. 3 : Rahat Sayed\nKhan and D.W. 4: Md. Naushad. Following documentary evidences were\nproduced from the side of the defendants:\n\"Exhibit-A.

While deciding issue no. 1 with regard to maintainability of the suit,\nthe learned trial Court recorded that since the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs and it was also clear from the evidence that the\nplaintiffs had fulfilled all the conditions for the maintainability of the suit\nthe suit was held to be maintainable. Accordingly, issue no. 1 was decided\nin favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 2 with regard to cause\nof action for filing the suit, the learned trial Court observed that since the\nmain issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs had been\nable to prove their case in the court and since their land was mutated\nillegally, therefore, the plaintiffs had a proper cause of action to bring the\nsuit. Therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of the plaintiffs. While\ndeciding the issue no. 3, the learned trial court recorded that the plaintiffs\nhad impleaded all the necessary parties in the suit, therefore, this issue was\nalso decided in favour of the plaintiffs. Since the main issue was decided\nagainst the plaintiffs, therefore the issue no.6 and 7 were also decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs. While giving its finding on issue no.10 i.e., whether\nthe suit was barred by law of limitation, the learned court observed that the\nsuit was not barred by the law of limitation because as soon as the plaintiffs\ncame to know about the cause of action, they sought the protection of the\ncourt for their right, title and possession. Accordingly, this issue was also\ndecided in favour of the plaintiffs. With regard to issue no. 11, the learned\ncourt gave its finding that since no evidence had been brought by the\n22\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nplaintiffs or the defendants on this issue and the main issue was decided in\nfavour of the plaintiffs, therefore, this issue was also decided in favour of\nthe plaintiffs.\n12.    While dealing with issue no. 4 i.e. as to whether the plaintiffs were\nentitled to the relief that the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed\nby defendant No. 5 in favour of defendant No. 6 and 7 be declared null and\nvoid, the learned trial court made an elaborate discussion and after\nconsidering the materials on record, the learned court held that it was clear\nfrom the evidences on record that the plaintiffs had received the property in\nquestion in the family partition. Therefore, the transfer of the said property\nby the defendant no. 1 to 4 to defendant no. 6 and 7 through the power of\nattorney holder (defendant no.5) was not valid as the said property had\nalready been received by the plaintiffs as a part of family partition and\nhence, the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no right to transfer the property.\nAccordingly, the sale deed No. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared as null\nand void and this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against\ndefendant nos. 5, 6 and 7. With regard to issue no. 8, the learned trial Court\nnoted that the plaintiffs had received half part of the disputed property in\nfamily partition and so they had right, title, interest and possession over half\nof the disputed property and were held entitled to get possession of the\nsame. Therefore, this point was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n13.    With regard to the issue of res-judicata i.e. issue no. 9, the learned\ntrial Court held that the suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata\nbecause in the earlier suit, Hari Narayan Parikh had claimed the entire\ndisputed property, in which this Court did not consider his claim to be\ncorrect and determined only half of his share. The learned trial Court further\nnoted that the issues which had been directly and clearly decided in the\npresent suit were completely different from that suit. Therefore, the learned\nCourt found that this suit was not barred by the rules of res judicata.\nAccordingly, this issue was decided in favour of the plaintiffs.\n14.    With regard to issue no. 5, the learned trial Court recorded that the\ndefendant no. 8 namely, Hari Narayan Parikh had the right to transfer the\nproperty of his share. Therefore, the learned court found that whatever\ntransfer was made by defendant no. 8 to the defendant no.9 by way of sale\n23\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeed no. 4324 dated 20.12.2012 was valid. It was held that the plaintiffs\nhad no right, title, interest and possession with respect to the portion of the\nland belonging to Hari Narayan Parikh. Issue no.5 was accordingly decided\nin favour of defendant nos. 8 and 9 and against the plaintiffs. There was\nanother sub-issue in issue no. 5 i.e., whether the order passed by the Circle\nOfficer, Chandil in the Mutation Case No. 2446/11-12 could be declared\nnull and void or not? This issue was decided against the plaintiffs and it was\nrecorded by the learned trial Court that the order related to mutation comes\nunder the jurisdiction of the Revenue Courts and it is necessary to follow\nthe prescribed procedure for it. Therefore, the learned Court could not\ndeclare the above mutation order null and void, rather the plaintiffs had the\nremedy that they could take appropriate action in the light of the order\npassed in the said case by submitting an application in the concerned\nRevenue Court under the procedure prescribed under the law.\n15.    The learned trial Court ultimately noted that in the light of the facts\nand circumstances and on the basis of the conclusions arrived after\ndetermining all the issues in the suit, it found that the plaintiffs were entitled\nto get a partial decree. Accordingly, the learned trial Court passed the\nfollowing order:\n(i) The plaintiffs were declared to have the right, title and possession\n      on half of the suit property which was described in Schedule \"A\".\n(ii) The plaintiffs were declared to be in possession of the aforesaid\n      portion of the suit property and if not found in possession, they be\n      given possession as per the legal process.\n(iii) Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012, by which the aforesaid\n      property was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\n      no. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7 was declared null and void and it was\n      also declared that defendant nos. 6 and 7 have no right over the\n      property claimed by them and whatever rights had been created on the\n      basis of the Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 was declared void.\n(iv) The order passed by the Circle Officer in the mutation case no.\n2446/2011-12 in favour of defendants nos. 6 and 7 could not be\n      declared illegal by the court because this matter falls under the\n      jurisdiction of the Revenue Court and the plaintiffs could take this\n24\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      matter before the competent authority in the light of the decision of the\n      learned trial Court.\n(v) An injunction was passed against defendants nos. 6 and 7 that they\n      should not enter the land described in Schedule-\"A\".\n(vi) Sale deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 vide which the half share of\n      the suit land was transferred by defendant no. 8 to defendant no. 9 was\n      declared valid and it was also declared that defendant no. 9 has right,\n      title and possession over that land.\n16.    Since the suit was partly decreed in favour of the plaintiffs only\nwith respect to Sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 by which the aforesaid\nproperty was transferred by defendant no.1 to 4 [through the defendant\nno. 5] to defendant no. 6 and 7, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 are the\nappellants before this court.\nArguments on behalf of the Appellants\n17.    Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the core issue\ninvolved in this case is related to issue no. 4 as framed by the learned trial\nCourt which is as under:\nwhether the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree declaring\n        that the registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\n        executed by defendant no. 5 in favour of defendant nos. 6\n        and 7 is null and void and did not confer any right in\n        favour of the defendants?\n18.    The learned counsel submits that the aforesaid issue has been decided\nby the learned trial Court vide paragraph 20 of the impugned judgment. He\nfurther submits that the learned trial Court has considered primarily the\npoint as to whether the vendor of the property had the right to sell the\nproperty. The court found that Exhibit 20 and 20/1 which were the\ndeposition in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 were relevant. A reference was made\nto the deposition of Joyesh M. Thakkar in the said case where he had\nsubmitted that the property was purchased from joint family fund by his\nfather who expired in the year 1972 and in the said suit, he also asserted\nthat in the year 1973, there was a partition in the family wherein his uncle\nIndulal G Thakkar had participated and the property in question fell in the\nshare of Indulal G Thakkar. A reference was also made to Exhibit- C in\n25\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nTitle Suit No. 42 of 1982 which has been marked as exhibit-16 in the\npresent suit. The deposition of the mother of Joyesh M. Thakkar namely\nSabita M. Thakkar in the earlier suit was also exhibited in the present suit\nwhich was marked as exhibit- 20/1 wherein she referred to exhibit-C\n(exhibit-16 in the present suit) as the document of partition.\n19.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nprimarily on the basis of the deposition in the Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 and\nthe exhibits thereunder, the learned trial Court held that the property\ninvolved in the aforesaid sale-deed did not fall in the share of the vendors\nof the property and consequently held that the vendors had no right to sell\nthe property and it was held to be null and void.\n20.   The learned counsel has referred to the plaint where in paragraph 8 it\nhas been mentioned that after the death of Manikant G. Thakkar, there was\nfamily partition of joint family properties amongst the 3 remaining brothers\nof late Manikant G. Thakkar and widow, sons and daughters of late\nManikant G. Thakkar. He submits that this statement was denied by\ndefendant nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 in their written statement vide paragraph 22\nwhich is quoted as under:\n\"22. That the statements made in para 8 and para 9 of the plaint are\n       totally false, incorrect and wrong and hereby denied by the\n       answering defendants as because there was no any such Family\n       Partition with respect to the land of the said Mauza- Kanderbera nor\n       the half portion of the Schedule-A land ever been allotted and given\n       in the share of Indulal G. Thakkar nor he possessed the said land till\n       his death nor the plaintiff came in possession of the land at any point\n       of time after the death of Indulal G. Thakkar.\"\n21.   The learned counsel has thereafter referred to Exhibit-16 which was\nexhibit-C in the previous suit [Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] and has submitted\nthat by no stretch of imagination the said document can be a document of\npartition. Admittedly, the same is an un-registered document and on bare\nperusal of Exhibit 16, it is apparent that it was not signed by sons and\ndaughters of Sabita M. Thakkar [wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] and further,\nthe document was not referring to any previous partition rather it was\nreferring to certain future adjustments amongst the family members. He has\nsubmitted that Exhibit- 16 being an unregistered document, was\ninadmissible in evidence. He has also submitted that Exhibit- 16 has not\n26\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nbeen proved by any of the witnesses, rather a certified copy of the same was\nprocured from the records of the earlier title suit and was simply marked\nexhibit.\n22.   The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that\nexhibit-C [ exhibit- 16 in the present suit] was asserted to be the document\nof partition and the said document is inadmissible in evidence. He has also\nsubmitted that the plea of partition was raised only to make out a case that\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 did not have any right to transfer the property. The\nlearned counsel submitted that if the partition is not accepted as valid, then\nthe defendant nos. 1 to 4 would have a share in the joint family and were\nentitled to transfer the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through their\npower of attorney holder i.e. defendant no. 5.\n23.   The learned counsel has also submitted that otherwise also in the\nevidence of Sabita M. Thakkar [ wife of Manikant G. Thakkar] in the\nprevious suit during her cross-examination she revealed that she had no idea\nregarding the partition, she is absolutely illiterate and in the said case she\ndeposed under the instructions of sons of Indulal G. Thakkar [ brother of\nManikant G. Thakkar] who are the plaintiffs in the present case.\n24.   Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the following\njudgments:\n(i)    AIR 1967 SC 341 (\nBasant Singh Vs. Janki Singh and\n           others\n) (paragraph 5),\n(ii)   (2010) 4 SCC 491 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n           and Another Vs. Ram Pal Singh Bisen\n) (paragraphs 21, 22, 25,\n           26 and 31).\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent Nos. 1 to 4\n25.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 to\n4 representing the plaintiffs of the case has referred to the judgment passed\nin Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 decided on 30th September 1999 which was\narising out of the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No. 42 of 1982\nwhereby the judgment passed by the learned trial Court was reversed. The\njudgment dated 30th September 1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\nwas marked as Exhibit- 22. The learned counsel has submitted that all the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 were party in the said proceedings. Though the suit\n27\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas initially fought between Hari Narayan Parikh on the one hand and the\nfamily members of Manikant G. Thakkar on the other, but in the said suit,\nall the family members had taken a specific stand that the property was\npurchased by Manikant G. Thakkar from joint family fund and after his\ndeath in the year 1972, there was a partition and the property involved in\nthe case to the extent it related to be in the name of Manikant G. Thakkar\nwas allocated to Indulal G Thakkar. He has referred to the written statement\nwhich was filed in the said case as recorded in the aforesaid appellate\ncourt's judgment at paragraph 4 and has submitted that the finding in that\nconnection has been recorded in paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment.\n26.   The learned counsel submits that once all the family members of\nManikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He submits that the\nallocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G Thakkar\nstood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present case\nhad no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour of defendant\nnos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5. He submits that the learned trial Court\nhas rightly held the sale-deed as void ab initio.\n27.   The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 4 has also relied\nupon the judgment passed in Second Appeal No. 101 of 1999(R) decided\non 14.02.2001 (Exhibit-13) arising out of the aforesaid Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982 and has submitted that at the second appellate stage also, it has been\nagain recorded that admittedly in the year 1972, after the death of Manikant\nG. Thakkar, there was partition in the family wherein half share of the suit\nproperty was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar. It was also recorded at the 2nd\nappellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid the consideration\namount to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- out of his joint family fund. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that since the defendant nos. 1 to 4 and the plaintiffs\nwere party in the appeal arising out of earlier title suit, they are bound by\nthe findings recorded in the said proceedings and if any contrary finding is\nrecorded by this Court with regard to factum of partition, the same would\namount to passing a contrary decree.\n28\n2025:JHHC:14099\n28.   The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (\n1997) 2 SCC 552 [Gorie Gouri Naidu\n(Minor) and Another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and Others\n] to submit\nthat even if erroneous, an inter party judgment binds the parties. He submits\nthat accordingly the earlier suit where a specific stand was taken by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 that there was a previous partition and finding to that\neffect recorded therein, the same is binding on the plaintiffs and defendant\nnos. 1 to 4 of the present case.\n29.   Learned counsel for the respondents has also submitted that\naccordingly registration or non-registration of the Exhibit-16 which was\nExhibit- C in the previous suit, has no relevance.\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent no. 9\n30.   The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 9 has\nsubmitted that he is just a formal party in the present case. Essentially the\nfight is between defendant nos. 1 to 7 and the plaintiffs.\nRejoinder Arguments on behalf of the Appellants\n31.   In response, learned counsel for the appellants has referred to the\njudgment passed in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 and has submitted that no\nissue was framed with regard to partition amongst the family of Thakkars\nand there was no occasion to frame such an issue as the earlier suit was\nessentially filed by Hari Narayan Parikh [defendant no. 8 in this case] who\nclaimed that the entire property was purchased by paying consideration\nexclusively by him and ultimately, the appeal was allowed and decided\nagainst Hari Narayan Parikh and the suit filed by Hari Narayan Parikh was\ndismissed.\n32.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that no issue\nregarding previous partition was framed either in the earlier suit or in the\npresent suit.\n33.   Point for determination\n                Whether the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\n                successors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had any right\n                to sell the property at schedule B (half share of\n                schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and 7\n                vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012?\n29\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n  Findings of this Court.\n34.   The plaintiffs had prayed for the following reliefs: -\n(i) for a declaration of right, title, interest of the plaintiffs over\n         half portion of the schedule 'A' land'.\n(ii) for confirmation of possession of the plaintiff over half\n         portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(iii) for a declaration that the sale deed No. 687 dated\n         06/03/2012 executed by the defendant No. 5 in favour of the\n         defendants No. 6 and 7 registered at Sub Registry office\n         Seraikella is null and void, and did not confer any right in\n         favour of the defendants No. 6 and 7.\n(iv) for a declaration that the sale deed. No. 4324 dated\n         20.10.2012 executed by the defendant No. 8 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9 registered at Sub Registry office Seraikella is\n         null and void and did not confer any right in favour of the\n         defendant No. 9.\n(v) for a declaration that the mutation order passed by the C.O.\n         Chandil in mutation case No. 2446/2011-12 in favour of the\n         defendant No. 6 and 7 is illegal and arbitrary.\n(vi) for an injunction restraining the defendants No. 6, 7 and 9\n         not to come over any portion of schedule 'A' land.\n(vii) for cost of the suit.\n(viii) for any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiffs are\n         deemed entitled under the law and equity.\"\n35.   The description of the property involved in this case is as under: -\nSchedule-'A'\n           Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n          Khata No. 102,            Plot No. 559, Area A0.46\n                                    Plot No. 560, Area A01.16\n                                    Plot No. 565, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 563, Area A01.64\n                                    Plot No. 558, Area A02.75\n                                    Plot No. 581, Area A02.89\n                                    Plot No. 586, Area A03.31\n                                    Plot No. 587, AreaA01.41\n                                    Plot No. 562, Area A01.30\n                                    Plot No. 557, Area A00.71\n                                          Total 17.94\n\n\n Schedule-'B' (half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 1 to 4 to\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through power of attorney holder-defendant no.5-\n              covered by sale deed No. 687 dated 06/03/2012 )\n            Mouza: Kandarbera, Thana No. 327, Anchal - Chandil\n            Khata No. 102,    Plot No. 563, Area 1.64\n                              Plot No. 565, Area 3.31\n30\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n                              Plot No. 581, Area 2.89\n                              Plot No. 559, Area 0.20\n                              Plot No. 560, Area 0.73\n                              Plot No. 562, Area 0.20\n                                    Total Area 8.97\n\n\n Schedule-'C'(half share of schedule A- sold by defendant no. 8 to\n  defendant no.9 covered by sale deed.

In this case the dispute is concerning schedule- B property only. So\nfar as schedule- C property is concerned, the suit has been dismissed and\nno appeal has been filed with respect to schedule- C property.\n37.   The contents of plaint and written statements filed by the respective\nparties have already been mentioned above. The details of the exhibits, the\npersons who deposed in favour of one or the other party has also been\nmentioned above.\n38.   As per the plaint, the plaintiffs sought declaration of right, title,\ninterest and possession over half portion of schedule-A property and sought\ndeclaration that sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 executed with regard\nto schedule-B property by defendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos.\n6 and 7 through defendant no. 5 and also the sale-deed no. 4324 dated\n20.10.2012 executed with regard to schedule-C property by defendant no.\n8 in favour of defendant no. 9 are null and void.\n39.   It was further case of the plaintiffs that all four sons were living\njointly and held properties jointly being a member of joint Hindu family\nand Manikant G. Thakkar being the eldest was the Karta who on 26.05.1959\nbeing Karta of joint Hindu family and out of joint family fund purchased\nschedule- A land along with defendant no. 8 in equal share by registered\n31\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nsale-deed. Admittedly, Defendant no. 8 is not the family member of\nThakkars.\n40.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs that Manikant G. Thakkar\nand his 3 brothers jointly possessed half portion of schedule-A land by\nmutual arrangement with defendant no. 8 and there has been no partition by\nmetes and bounds between Manikant G. Thakkar and his brothers on the\none hand and defendant no. 8 on the other. Manikant G. Thakkar died in\nthe year 1972 living behind original plaintiff no. 1 namely, Sabita M.\nThakkar, two sons and two daughters and after death of Sabita M. Thakkar,\nher name was deleted and her children remained as defendant nos. 1 to 4 in\nthe suit.\n41.    It was the specific case of the plaintiffs who were legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Indulal G. Thakkar that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar,\nthere was a family partition of joint family properties amongst the\nremaining three brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar and the widow, sons and\ndaughters of Manikant G. Thakkar and in the said family partition the half\nportion of schedule-A property was exclusively allotted to the share of\nIndulal G. Thakkar who possessed the same till his death and thereafter, the\nplaintiffs came in possession of the same. The document in relation to\npartition has been exhibited as exhibit-16 which is dated 16.02.1973. On\nthis score it has been the case of the plaintiffs that defendant no. 1 to 4 had\nno right, title and interest to transfer property to the defendant no. 6 and 7\nthrough their power of attorney holder - defendant no.5.\n42.    The plaint also discloses that defendant no. 8 had filed a Title Suit\nNo. 42 of 1982 claiming to be the owner of the entire schedule- A property\non the ground that the co-purchaser Manikant G. Thakkar did not pay any\nconsideration amount and therefore, Manikant G. Thakkar had relinquished\nhis share in favour of defendant no. 8. The said suit was decreed in favour\nof defendant no. 8 vide judgment dated 30.05.1992 against which the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 of the present suit had filed Title Appeal No. 10 of\n1992. The plaintiffs of the present case were added as co-appellants in the\nsaid title appeal. It has been further asserted that in the Title Suit No. 42 of\n1982, widow of Manikant G. Thakkar deposed that half portion of\nschedule-A land was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar in the\n32\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfamily partition held in the year 1973. She also gave evidence in the title\nsuit to this effect and before tax recovery tribunal also similar statement\nwas given that the property was allotted to the share of Indulal G. Thakkar.\nThe plaint further reveals that the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 was decided\nand it was declared that Manikant G. Thakkar had paid his share of\nconsideration from the joint family fund and accordingly had right, title and\ninterest over half share of the land and this happened vide judgment dated\n30.09.1999.\n43.   Hari Narayan Parikh, the plaintiff of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No.\n42 of 1982] preferred a 2nd appeal before High Court which was numbered\nas S.A. No. 101 of 1999(R) but the said second appeal was dismissed.\n44.   It was the case of the plaintiffs that they came in possession of half\nshare of the schedule -A land but defendant nos. 1 and 2 took steps for\ndemarcation of half share of schedule-A land and there were connected\nproceedings which became the cause of action. The plaint also discloses\nthat the defendant nos. 1 to 4 through power of attorney sold the schedule-\nB property in the name of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and mutation was also\ncarried out in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 in spite of objection raised\nby the plaintiffs.\n45.   It was stated in the plaint that further, the defendant no. 8 sold 8.97\nacres of schedule-A land in favour of defendant no. 9 by executing\nregistered sale-deed no. 4324 dated 20.10.2012 which is the land described\nas schedule- C property.\n46.   Thus, half share of schedule - A property was sold by defendant nos.\n1 to 4 to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and the remaining half share of schedule -\nA property was sold by defendant no. 8 in favour of defendant no. 9. The\nproperties sold are described in schedule-B and C respectively. Mutation\nwas also done accordingly.\n47.   The plaintiffs challenged both the sale-deeds on the ground that there\nhas been no partition by metes and bounds with defendant no. 8 so he did\nnot have the right to sell half share of the property [schedule- C property -\nhalf share of schedule- A property]. Further ground was taken by the\nplaintiffs that in the family partition amongst Thakkars, the half share of\nschedule-A property was allotted exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar [father\n33\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the plaintiffs], therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [ legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had no right to sell schedule- B\nproperty [half share of schedule A property] to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and\nconsequently, both the sale-deeds were null and void.\n48.   On the other hand, the specific case of the contesting defendant nos.\n1 to 7, who were contesting the case so far as schedule B property [half\nshare of schedule A property] is concerned, was that it was wrong to say\nthat all brothers, i.e. all four sons of the deceased Govindjee B. Thakkar\nwere living jointly where the eldest brother Manikant G. Thakkar, being the\nmember of the joint Hindu Family, was the \"Karta\" of joint Hindu family.\nIt was their specific case that the land was jointly purchased by Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and was not purchased from the joint\nfamily fund by Manikant G. Thakkar and since after purchase both were in\npeaceful joint possession and their names were recorded jointly in the\nrecord-of-rights. After death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his widow Savita M.\nThakkar (since deceased), two sons Jayesh M. Thakkar (defendant no. 1)\nand Hemant M. Thakkar (defendant no.2), and three daughters namely Priti\nM. Thakkar (defendant no.4), Rajni M. Thakkar (defendant no. 3) and Usa\nM. Thakkar being the heirs and successors of deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar came jointly in possession of half share of the schedule-A land and\nsince then, they had been in joint peaceful possession over their half\nundivided portion and share of the schedule-A land along with said Hari\nNarayan Parikh. Legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar, being\nin need of money, jointly sold their half portion and share of the schedule-\nA land to defendant nos. 6 and 7 vide sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nthrough their power of attorney holder defendant no.5. Since then, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 were in peaceful possession over their half portion\nof the schedule-A land and they also got the land mutated in their name and\nwere paying rent to the Government of Jharkhand as well as doing their\nbusiness over the said land.\n49.   It was the specific case of the defendant no. 1 to 7 that there was no\nany Family Partition with respect to the suit land nor the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever allotted and given in the share of father of the\nplaintiffs nor they or their father Indulal G. Thakkar ever possessed the suit\n34\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nland. The stand taken in the earlier Title Suit No. 42 of 1982 was explained\nby stating that after death of Manikant G. Thakkar, the widow of Manikant\nG. Thakkar namely Smt. Sabita M. Thakkar on having trust and faith on\nplaintiff no. 2 namely, Prakash I. Thakkar contested the Title Suit No. 42\nof 1982 against the defendant no. 8 and on his advice, adduced evidence\nalong with her son in the said title suit to save the half portion of their\nschedule-A land from the hands of the defendant no. 8 who brought the\nsaid Title Suit No. 42 of 1982. It was stated by the defendants that there\nwas no such alleged partition with respect to the said half portion of the\nschedule -A land nor the half portion of the schedule-A land was ever\nallotted and given by the heirs and successors of the deceased Manikant G.\nThakkar to Indulal G. Thakkar nor the possession of the half portion of the\nschedule-A land was ever given to the said Indulal G. Thakkar nor the\nplaintiffs ever came in possession over the half portion of the schedule-A\nland at any point of time. It was asserted that the plaintiffs had no rights,\ntitle, interest or even possession over the half portion of the schedule-A land\nat any point of time and the defendant no. l to 4 who being the heirs of the\ndeceased Manikant G. Thakkar acquired and possessed the half portion of\nthe Schedule-A land of their deceased father Manikant G. Thakkar and who\nbeing lawful owner having all rights, title, interest and possession over the\nhalf portion of Schedule-A land rightly transferred their half portion and\nshare of schedule-A land in favour of the defendant nos. 6 & 7 through their\nlawful Attorney defendant No.5 and the claim of the plaintiffs were totally\nfalse, incorrect and wrong.\n50.   It is not in dispute that schedule -A property consisted of 17.94 acres\nat mouza Kandarbera, P.S. Chandil and the plaintiffs and defendant nos. 1\nto 4 as well as proforma defendant nos. 10, 11 and 12 had common ancestor\nnamely, Govindji B. Thakkar who died leaving behind four sons including\nManikant G. Thakkar and Indulal G. Thakkar. It is further not in dispute\nthat the schedule A property was purchased in the joint name of defendant\nno.8 and Manikant G. Thakkar. It is also not in dispute that plaintiffs are\nlegal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and defendant no. 1 to 4\nare legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar.\n35\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThe bone of contention is whether there was a partition in the year 1973\nand whether the half share of schedule A property was allocated exclusively\nto Indulal G. Thakkar in such partition so as to entitle the plaintiffs to claim\nexclusive title over half share of schedule A property and disentitle the\ndefendant no. 1 to 4 to sell half share of schedule A property to the\ndefendant no. 6 and 7 through registered sale deed covering Schedule B\nproperty and hence such sale deed was null and void.\n51.    Altogether 4 witnesses have been examined on behalf of the\nplaintiffs.\n52.    P.W. 1 is Raja Manjhi, who has stated that the plaintiffs have been in\ncontinuous possession of the suit property and he had not seen anybody else\npossessing the same.

Was in any family arrangement dated 16.1.73 the property\n      in schedule 'A' was allotted to the sole brother of Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar?\"\n62.   The points for determination as framed by the learned 1st appellate\ncourt in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 are as under: -\n\"(i) Whether the respondent has got valid cause of action for the\n      suit?\n(ii) Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?\n(iii) Whether it is barred by law of limitation?\n(iv) Whether respondent has got exclusive right, title and interest\n      over the suit property?\n(v) Whether suit property was acquired by the joint family of\n      Mani Kant G Thakkar along with respondent?\n(vi) Whether consideration money was paid by respondent alone\n      as alleged by him?\n(vii) Whether respondent acquired right title over the suit property\n      by way of adverse possession?\n63.   The learned 1st appellate court decided points of determination nos.\n(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in paragraph 8 of the judgment as under: -\n\"8. The above points are interlinked and related to each other,\n      therefore, they are taken together for determination. The respondent\n      has examined 13 witnesses and also filed certain documents marked\n      exhibits in this suit. P.W.1,2,3,4,6,10 and 12 are formal witnesses.\n      Whereas P.W.5,7,8,9,11 and 13 respondent himself are the witnesses\n      on material points. Exhibit A series are signatures, Exhibit 2 series\n      are rent receipts, Exhibit 3 series are wealth tax returns whereas\n      Ext.4 series are statement attached to Ext.3 series, Ext.5 series are\n      assessment orders inconsonance with the returns, Ext.6 is the typed\n      letter dated 28.9.91 addressed to Income Tax Department, alleged\n      to be written by Sabita M. Thakkar. Ext.7 is agreement of lease,\n      alleged to be executed by respondent dated 20.3.92 in favour of\n      Gram Vikash Kendra Jamshedpur. Ext.8 is the sale deed dated\n      5.10.59 by virtue of which suit property was purchased in the name\n      of the respondent Hari Narayan Parekh and Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar.\"\n48\n2025:JHHC:14099\n64.   The findings of the learned 1st appellate court are in paragraph nos.\n11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of its judgment whose important extracts for\nthe purposes of this case are quoted as under: -\n11. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidence of the\n      respondent/plaintiff regarding his exclusive title over the suit\n      property. It is an admitted fact that the suit property was jointly\n      purchased by the respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar vide\n      registered sale deed dated 26.9.59 on payment of consideration\n      money of Rs. 10,000/- vide Ext. 8. It is also an admitted fact that\n      in revisional survey which was finally published in the year 1964\n      the suit property was jointly recorded in the names of Mani Kant\n      G. Thakkar and respondent Hari Narayan Parekh. The respondent\n      (P.W.13) in para-15 has clearly admitted that he filed objection\n      against the settlement but the same was turned down by the\n      settlement authorities. The rent receipts filed and proved on behalf\n      of respondent have been marked Ext.2 series in this case. The rent\n      receipts relates to 1971 to 1986. There is no rent receipts for the\n      year 1975 to 1984. From perusal of the receipts it is evidently\n      clear that it is in the joint names of the respondent and the said\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar. ........................ Moreover, the above\n      documents do not substantiate the exclusive right, title and\n      possession of the respondent over the suit property.\n12. Exhibit -6 is the typed letter dated 28.9.81 addressed to the\n      Tax Recovery Officer Ranchi alleged to have been written by\n      Sabita M. Thakkar (Original defendant No.1) wife of Mani Kant.\nG. Thakkar. It is alleged by the respondent that by writing this\n      letter said Sabita M. Thakkar clearly admitted that her husband\n      Mani Kant G. Thakkar has got no title and interest over the suit\n      property rather the same is exclusively belong to the respondent. I\n      find that the learned court below has also given much importance\n      of Ext.6. The learned court below has held that Ext.6 is the settler\n      with regard to exclusive ownership of the respondent over the suit\n      property. At the very out set I would like to mention here that there\n      is no whisper regarding Ext.6 in the whole pleading of the\n      respondent. Moreover, it is a typed letter bearing only signature of\n      Sabita M. Thakkar. Admittedly respondent Hari Narayan Parekh\n      was very close friend of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar. Sabita M.\n      Thakkar (D.W.12) has stated in her evidence that respondent was\n      in visiting term as brother. The respondent obtained her signature\n      on a blank paper in good faith. The respondent (P.W.13) has stated\n      in para-7 of his evidence that the suit property was attached by\n      Tax Recovery Officer for which Sabita M Thakkar submitted a\n      written report that the land in question belongs to the respondent.\n      He has further said that Sabita M. Thakkar simply signed over the\n      letter. He has proved simply signature marked Ext.6 in this case.\n49\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nНе has also stated that the letter was typed by one B.L. Sharma.\nIn para -22 he has further admitted that Ext.6 is a typed letter. It\ndoes not bear the signature of Typist to prove this fact that same\nwas typed by B.L. Sharma. There is no mention of any date and/or\nsignature of Sabita M. Thakkar. The respondent has clearly\nadmitted that Mani Kant G. Thakkar was his good friend and he\nwas on visiting terms in his house. In view of the facts stated above\nthis seems to be spurious document. Sabita M. Thakkar\nemphatically denied the existence of Ext.6. She has expressed her\nignorance with regard to the contents of the Ext.6. Moreover Ext.6\nwas never read and explained to her. I have already stated above\nthat there is no pleading of the respondent in his plaint with regard\nto existence of Ext.6. Exhibit -7 is the agreement of lease between\nrespondent and Gram Vikash Kendra. The respondent has proved\nExt.7 in order to substantiate his exclusive right, title and\npossession over the suit property. Ext.7 goes to show that the\nrespondent entered into an agreement with Gram Vikash Kenra on\n20.3.82 for some portion of the suit property for a period of 10\nyears. Admittedly it is an unregistered document prepared on 3\nrupees stamp paper. It contains 3 pages. There is no signature of\neither lessor or lessee in two pages. The later page has been\nsigned by respondent and Secretary Gram Vikash Kendra\nJamshedpur.\nSection 107\nof T. P. Act Provided that lease of\nimmovable property from year to year for any term exceeding one\nyear or receiving yearly rent can be made only by registered\ndocument. Lease for agricultural purpose are exempted from the\nprovisions of\nsection 107\nT. P. Act. Such lease may be made orally\nor in writing and if made in writing requires registration\nu/s 17(i)\n(d) if they are year to year or for any terms exceeding one year or\nreceiving yearly rent.\nSection 117\nT.P. Act also provides that a\nlease for agricultural purpose is not necessary to be made by\nwritten agreement and when so affected no registration is\nrequired. But if transaction is reduced to writing then in the case\nof lease from year to year or for any term exceeding one year of\nreceiving a yearly rent registration would be under\nsection 117\nof\nRegistration Act and if unregistered the lease will be inadmissible\nin evidence under\nsection 49\nof the act and other evidence of its\nterms will also be precluded by\nsection 91\nof Evidence Act. Thus,\nI find that Ext.7 is hit by the provisions of\nIndian Registration Act\n,\nmoreover it also appears that Ext.7 has been created in the year\n1982 prior to the filing of the suit by the respondent and after the\norder of the Hon'ble High Court dated 25.2.82 in C.W.J.C No. 281\nof 1982 by which respondent was advised to file regular suit for\ndeclaration of his title over suit property.\n13. Now let us examine the oral and documentary evidences of the\nappellants. D.W.4. has stated that his father was 4 brothers and\n50\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ntheir family was joint Hindin family. The eldest brother Mani\nKant G. Thakkar was karta of the family. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\nand respondent Hari Narayan Parekh were close friends. Both\nof them purchased schedule 'A' property by registered sale deed\nin the year 1959 for consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Mani Kant G.\nThakkar paid his share to Rs.5000/- out of the joint family fund.\nMani Kant G. Thakkar died in the year 1972 leaving behind his\nwidow, sons and daughters. In the year 1973 there was family\npartition amongst the heirs of Mani Kant G. Thakkar and other\nmembers of the joint family. In the said family partition suit\nproperty was allotted in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. This witness has proved the paper of family\narrangement dated 16.2.93 marked Ext.C in this case. Ext.C.\nbears signature of all the co-sharers of the joint family property.\nHe has further stated that there was tax recovery case against\nMani Kant G. Thakker in which he filed objection (Ext. D) that\nthe suit property fall in the share of his father Indulal G.\nThakkar. He has also filed objection against auction (Ext.D/1)\nbefore the Income Tax authorities. D.W.9 and D.W.12 the son\nand the wife of Mani Kant G. Thakkar have also supported the\ncase of the appellants in their evidences. The learned court below\nhas held that Ext. C (Family arrangement) is a spurious\ndocument and the same has been created by D.W.4 only to put\nhis claim over the suit property. The view expressed by the\nlearned court below is not logical and convincing. It is definite\ncase of the appellant from the very beginning that Mani Kant G.\nThakkar was 4 brothers and he was Karta of the family. He paid\nRs.5000/- out of the joint family fund. Mani Kant G. Thakkar\ndied in the year 1972 and thereafter there was partition in Joint\nfamily property and by way of family arrangement on 16.3.73\nvide (Ext.C) suit property was allotted to Indulal G. Thakkar,\nfather of the intervener appelants. I do not find specific denial\nby the respondent or his witnesses in this regard. The respondent\nand his witnesses have simply stated that they have no knowledge\nabout the family arrangement of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\nwhich the suit property was allotted to the share of Indulal G.\nThakkar. Moreover Ext. C is the family arrangement of the\nappellants. None of the co-sharers have raised objection against\nthe above family arrangement. The son (D.W.9) and the wife\n(DW.12) of the said Mani Kant G. Thakkar have supported the\nclaim of family arrangements. There is no dispute in it that the\nfamily arrangement may be done either orally or in writing.\nThus, the findings of the learned court below seems to be\nperverse and unjustified.\n51\n2025:JHHC:14099\n15. In order to substantiate his exclusive title and possession, the\n      respondent has proved returns of wealth tax and income tax (Ext.3\n      series and 4 series). .............................\n16. Having the discussions made above and after critical analysis\n      of oral and documentary evidence of the parties, I find that the\n      respondent has got no exclusive right, title and interest over the\n      suit property. The suit property was jointly acquired by the\n      respondent and Mani Kant G. Thakkar. The said Mani Kant G.\n      Thakkar paid his share of consideration amount of Rs.5000/- out\n      of joint family fund. After the death of Mani Kant G. Thakkar in\n      the year 1972, there was partition in the family and the ½ share in\n      the suit property was allotted to Indu Lal G. Thakkar. It may be\n      noted that heirs of Indu Lal G. Thakkar has been added as co-\n      appellants by the order of the Hon'ble High Court dated 28.6.99\n      passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R). Thus, the above 4 points\n      are accordingly decided in favour of the appellants and against\n      the respondent.\"\n65.   The perusal of the aforesaid judgement passed in Title Appeal No.\n10 of 1992 arising out of the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] between\nthe legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh reveals\nthat at the stage of trial the legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh were the parties and the legal heirs and successors of\nIndulal G. Thakkar were added as co-appellants by the order of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court dated 28.06.1999 passed in Civil Revision No.122/99(R).\nMeaning thereby, that the suit was never contested between the legal heirs\nand successors of Indulal G. Thakkar and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G Thakkar. Moreover, the judgement passed by the learned 1 st\nappellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 reveals that the findings of\nthe learned trial court that the family arrangement (exhibit- C) was spurious\ndocument was interfered primarily on the ground that the family\narrangement [Ext. C] was of the appellants of the said case and none of the\nco-sharers had raised objection against the above family arrangement. The\nson (D.W.9) and the wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar supported the\nclaim of family arrangement and learned 1st appellate court in the said title\nappeal held that family arrangement may be done either orally or in writing\nand it was also held that the findings of the learned trial court that the family\narrangement (exhibit-C) was a spurious document seemed to be perverse\nand unjustified.\n52\n2025:JHHC:14099\n66.   This Court is of the considered view that the legality and validity of\nthe family arrangement which was admittedly unregistered document was\nnever examined in the aforesaid appeal and it was accepted without any\nadjudication as to its legality or validity in the eyes of law and without\nexamination as to whether the said document of family arrangement can be\nsaid to be a document of family partition as none of the co-sharers raised\nobjection against the above family arrangement and the son (D.W.9) and\nthe wife (DW.12) of Manikant G. Thakkar had also supported the claim of\nfamily arrangement.\n67.   The learned trial court in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\ndecided issue nos. 7 to 10 in favour of the plaintiff Hari Narayan Parikh and\nagainst the legal heirs and successors of Manikant G. Thakkar. The learned\n1st appellate court in Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992 did not frame any issue\nrelating to the issue no.10 framed by the learned trial court, as to whether\npursuant to the family arrangement the property was allotted to the sole\nbrother of Manikant G Thakkar. The fact also remains that Manikant G.\nThakkar were four brothers and Indulal G. Thakkar was not the sole brother\nof Manikant G. Thakkar. Apparently, there was no occasion to enter into\nsuch issue as the point for consideration was whether Manikant G. Thakkar\nhad paid his share of consideration for the suit property purchased in the\njoint name of Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh.\n68.   This Court finds that even the facts as to whether the so-called family\narrangement ever eventually ended up in allocation of exclusive right, title,\ninterest and possession to Indulal G. Thakkar (father of the plaintiffs of the\npresent case) with respect to the half share of schedule A property involved\nin this case which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh and whether there was any partition by metes and bound\nin the family of Thakkars and whether the unregistered family settlement\nwas at all admissible in evidence, were neither examined nor considered\nnor were the subject matter of consideration in the earlier title suit [ Title\nSuit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar\nand Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar became\nparty as co-appellants for the first time only at the appellate stage. The issue\nin the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\n53\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh was as to whether\nManikant G Thakkar had contributed in the payment of consideration for\nthe property which was jointly purchased by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari\nNarayan Parikh, who admittedly do not belong to the same family; in the\nearlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] Hari Narayan Parikh claimed\nexclusive right , title and interest over the entire property purchased in the\njoint name of Hari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G Thakkar by stating that\nthe entire consideration amount was paid only by Hari Narayan Parikh and\nlegal heirs of Manikant G Thakkar had taken a stand that the half\nconsideration amount was paid by Manikant G Thakkar from his joint\nfamily fund and accordingly it was held in the Title Appeal No. 10 of 1992\narising out of earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] that the property was\njointly acquired by Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh and\nManikant G Thakkar paid his share of consideration out of joint family\nfund.\n69.     The learned counsel for the respondents (representing the original\nplaintiffs - legal heirs of Indulal G. Thakkar ) has submitted that once all\nthe family members of Manikant G. Thakkar had taken a specific stand in\nthe earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982] fought between the legal heirs\nof Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh that there was a partition\nand the property was allocated in the name of Indulal G Thakkar, there was\nno occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. He has also argued\nthat the allocation of share of the suit property in the name of Indulal G.\nThakkar stood concluded and therefore, the defendant nos. 1 to 4 of the\npresent case had no right, title and interest to transfer the property in favour\nof defendant nos. 6 and 7 through defendant no. 5.\n70.     In view of the aforesaid discussions with respect to the allocation of\nhalf share of the schedule A property relatable to share of Manikant G\nThakkar, this Court finds that there is no finding in the Title Appeal No. 10\nof 1992 regarding allocation of share of the suit property in the name of\nIndulal G. Thakkar through family arrangement and the finding is that\nManikant G Thakkar contributed from joint family fund to purchase the\nproperty. In view of the aforesaid discussions, this court is also of the\nconsidered view that merely because the legal heirs of Manikant G.\n54\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar had taken a plea in the earlier suit [ Title Suit No. 42 of 1982]\nfought with a third party , namely, Hari Narayan Parikh who is outside the\nfamily of Thakkars that there was a family arrangement and the property\nwas allocated in the name of Indulal G. Thakkar, it cannot be said that there\nis no occasion for them to deny the factum of partition. The factum of\npartition and allocation of share was certainly required to be proved as per\nlaw in order to claim that the half share of the property jointly purchased in\nthe name of Manikant G Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh fell into the\nshare of Indulal G. Thakkar and that he came in exclusive possession of\nthe same, which the plaintiffs ( the legal heirs and successors of Indulal G.\nThakkar ) miserably failed to prove and this would be evident from the\nfollowing discussion of the materials on record.\n71.   The evidences led on behalf of the plaintiffs and the defendants, both\noral and documentary have been mentioned above.\n72.   This court finds that P.W-1 has no idea about the ownership,\nlocation, neighbourhood, boundaries, land use etc. of the suit property nor\nhas any idea about the family members of Thakkars. This witness does not\nhelp the plaintiffs to prove their case with respect to possession, partition\nor allocation of this property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and then\ndevolution upon legal heirs and successors of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\ncourt further finds that P.W-2 also has no idea about the partition and\nallocation of share exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar as claimed by the\nplaintiffs and has no idea about the details of the property and he has stated\nthat the property was in possession of the defendant Rahat Saeed Khan who\nhas constructed some house over the property and is carrying on business\nfrom the said property. This court finds that the oral evidence of P.W-3\ndoes not give the details of so called partition, neither the unregistered\nfamily settlement has been proved nor the factum of partition has been\nproved nor the allocation of schedule B property exclusively to Indulal G.\nThakkar has been proved nor the possession of Indulal G. Thakkar and then\nof the plaintiffs beings sons of Indulal G. Thakkar has been proved and\nthe possession of the defendant no.6 and 7 over the property has been\nadmitted. This court also finds that the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar, the evidences\n55\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nled in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral evidence.\nHowever, the records reveal that the said documents were simply filed and\nmarked as exhibits. This witness has also admitted that wife of Manikant G\nThakkar became helpless after the death of her husband and was totally\ndependent upon the plaintiffs /their father Indulal G. Thakkar in conducting\nthe court proceedings and had never faced any litigation earlier.\n73.   This Court finds that D.W. 1 has fully supported the case of the\ndefendants and has also stated that the property was jointly purchased by\nHari Narayan Parikh and Manikant G. Thakkar and while in jointness,\nManikant G. Thakkar expired leaving behind his legal heirs who divided\nthe property mutually with Hari Narayan Parikh and came in exclusive\npossession. Thereafter, legal heirs of Manikant G. Thakkar sold the\nproperty to defendant nos. 6 and 7 and handed over the possession to them.\nSince then, the defendant nos. 6 and 7 have been in continuous possession\nof the property and have constructed house, workshop and shed over the\nproperty and also got their name mutated in the revenue records. He has\nalso given the description of the property and the manner it was being used\ni.e. in some portion there was cultivation of paddy every year and in the\nremaining portion, there were Mango trees and vegetables were also grown.\nEven during cross-examination, no material contradiction has been brought\non record, rather he has clearly denied that Indulal G. Thakkar ever came\nin possession of the property and also denied that later on his descendants\nwere in possession and denied the right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with respect to the property. So far as D.W. 2 is concerned, he has\nsupported the case of the defendants with regards to right, title, interest and\npossession of defendant nos. 6 and 7 and he has also supported that the\nproperty was purchased jointly by Manikant G. Thakkar and Hari Narayan\nParikh. This witness has stated that he has his own property in the same\nlocality and he had no idea that Indulal G. Thakkar was brother of Manikant\nG. Thakkar nor he knew the brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar or their\nchildren nor he had any idea that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased the\nproperty from joint family fund. He denied that Indulal G. Thakkar or their\nchildren ever came in possession of the property. D.W. 3 is the defendant\nno. 6 who has fully supported the case of the defendants and has duly\n56\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\ndeposed and supported his right, title, intertest and possession over the\nproperty. He has also stated that he has constructed a house, got installed a\nhandpump and has been growing mango trees, paddy and vegetables on the\nproperty and he has got his name mutated in the revenue records after\npurchasing the property through sale-deed no. 687 dated 05.03.2012 for a\nconsideration of Rs. 30 lakhs from the legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar who handed over the physical possession of the\nproperty to him. He has also stated that Manikant G. Thakkar had purchased\nthe property from his own source of income and not from joint family fund\nand that the plaintiffs or their father Indulal G. Thakkar did not ever have\nright, title, interest or possession over the suit property. He has also stated\nthat at the time of death of Manikant G. Thakkar, his children were minor\nand his wife was not educated and was a housewife. She remained in\ndistress for maintenance of herself and her children and used to trust\nPrakash I. Thakkar who had prepared false documents and in fact, no\ndocument regarding family partition was made and if there was any such\ndocument, the same was forged and fabricated. He has also taken electricity\nconnection over the suit property. This witness has been thoroughly cross-\nexamined. He is not aware about brothers of Manikant G. Thakkar. He\ndenied that there was any family partition and the property was allotted to\nIndulal G. Thakkar. He had given the boundary of the property and denied\nthat the plaintiffs were forcibly removed from property. D.W. 4 has\nexhibited the rent receipts and also the receipts issued by Jharkhand State\nElectricity Board and has given the names of the officers who were posted\nat the relevant point of time.\n74.   The oral evidences on record clearly demonstrate that the plaintiffs\nfailed to prove that they or even their father Indulal G. Thakkar were ever\nin possession of the property. Rather, the defendants have proved through\ncogent evidence that Manikant G. Thakkar and after his death, his legal\nheirs and successors including his wife and defendant nos. 1 to 4, were in\npossession of the property and they sold their half share to defendant nos.\n6 and 7 who also got their name mutated in revenue records and were\npaying rent. There is no documentary evidence from the side of the\nplaintiffs that the property was ever possessed by them or even by their\n57\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nfather Indulal G. Thakkar at any point of time. Their entire case is based on\nunregistered family arrangement of the year 1973 (exhibit-16) but there is\nnothing on record to show that it was ever acted upon. On perusal of exhibit\n-16 there is no mention of any previous partition and it is certainly not a\nmemorandum of partition and in absence of registration the same is\ninadmissible in evidence.\n75.    As already observed above, the documents from the earlier suit, its\nwritten statement filed by the wife of Manikant G Thakkar and the\nevidences led in the said suit were not proved and exhibited during the oral\nevidence. However, the records reveal that the said documents were simply\nfiled and marked as exhibits.\n76.\nIn the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of\n\"\nBasant Singh v. Janki Singh\n\" reported in (1967) 1 SCR 1 : (1967) 1 SCJ\n476 : AIR 1967 SC 341 it has been held that an admission in a pleading can\nbe used only for the purpose of the suit in which the pleading was filed but\nin other suits, this admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is\nopen to the party to show that it is not true. The paragraphs relevant for the\npurposes of this case are quoted as under:-\n\"5. The High Court also observed that an admission in a\n      pleading can be used only for the purpose of the suit in which\n      the pleading was filed. The observations of Beaumont, C.J. in\nRamabai Shriniwas v. Bombay Government\nlend some\n      countenance to this view.\nBut those observations were\n      commented upon and explained by the Bombay High Court\n      in\nD.S. Mohlte v. S.I. Mohile\n. An admission by a party in a\n      plaint signed and verified by him in a prior suit is an\n      admission within the meaning of\nSection 17\nof the Indian\n      Evidence Act, 1872, and may be proved against him in other\n      litigations. The High Court also relied on the English law of\n      evidence. In Phipson on Evidence, 10th Edn, Article 741, the\n      English law is thus summarised:\n\"Pleadings, although admissible in other actions, to\n        show the institution of the suit and the nature of the\n        case put forward, are regarded merely as the\n        suggestion of counsel, and are not receivable against\n        a party as admissions, unless sworn, signed, or\n        otherwise adopted by the party himself.\"\nThus, even under the English law, a statement in a pleading\n      sworn, signed or otherwise adopted by a party is admissible\n58\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\n      against him in other actions. In Marianski v. Cairns the\n      House of Lords decided that an admission in a pleading\n      signed by a party was evidence against him in another suit\n      not only with regard to a different subject-matter but also\n      against a different opponent. Moreover, we are not\n      concerned with the technicalities of the English law.\nSection\n      17\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes no distinction\n      between an admission made by a party in a pleading and\n      other admissions. Under the Indian law, an admission made\n      by a party in a plaint signed and verified by him may be used\n      as evidence against him in other suits. In other suits, this\n      admission cannot be regarded as conclusive, and it is open\n      to the party to show that it is not true.\"\n77.\nIn the judgement passed in the case of \"\nLIC Vs. Ram Pal Singh\nBisen\n\" reported in (2010) 4 SCC 491 : (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2010) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1072, it has been held that mere admission of a document in\nevidence does not amount to its proof, in other words, mere marking of\nexhibit on a document does not dispense with its proof, which is required\nto be done in accordance with law. It has been held that under the law of\nevidence also, it is necessary that contents of documents are required to be\nproved either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most, admission\nof documents may amount to admission of contents but not its truth. It has\nalso been held that the contents of the document cannot be proved by merely\nfiling in a court. The paragraphs relevant for the purposes of this case are\nquoted as under :-\n\"21. It is also necessary to mention here that Rule 2-A of\nOrder 12 CPC\ndeals with the situation where notice of\n      admission as contemplated in\nOrder 12 Rule 2 CPC\nhas been\n      served but is not denied, then the same shall be deemed to have\n      been admitted. Similarly, Rule 3-A of the aforesaid Order\n      grants power to the court to admit any document in evidence,\n      even if no notice has been served. The aforesaid provisions of\n      law have been brought in the Code vide amendment by Act No.\n      104 of 1976 w.e.f. 1-2-1977.\n22. Records do not reveal that any such procedure was adopted\n      either by the appellants or by the trial court to prove the\n      documents filed by the appellants and mark them as exhibits.\n      Thus, no advantage thereof could be accrued to the appellants,\n      even if it is assumed that the said documents have been admitted\n      by the respondent and were then exhibited and marked.\n59\n2025:JHHC:14099\n25. We are of the firm opinion that mere admission of a\n      document in evidence does not amount to its proof. In other\n      words, mere marking of exhibit on a document does not\n      dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in\n      accordance with law.\n26. As has been mentioned hereinabove, despite perusal of the\n      record, we have not been able to come to know as to under what\n      circumstances the respondent-plaintiff had admitted those\n      documents. Even otherwise, his admission of those documents\n      cannot carry the case of the appellants any further and much to\n      the prejudice of the respondent.\n31. Under the law of evidence also, it is necessary that contents\n      of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by\n      secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may\n      amount to admission of contents but not its truth. Documents\n      having not been produced and marked as required under the\nEvidence Act\ncannot be relied upon by the court. Contents of\n      the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.\"\n78.    The law is well settled that a family arrangement which creates,\ndeclares, assigns, limits or extinguishes any right, title or interest in\nimmovable property including joint family property is compulsorily\nregistrable under\nsection 17\nof Indian Registration Act, 1908. This Court is\nof the considered view that the unregistered deed of partition/family\narrangement (exhibit-16) cannot be relied upon for proving division of\nproperty and is inadmissible for establishing the terms of partition or the\ndivision of property.\n79.    So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents representing the plaintiffs is concerned, which is reported in\n(1997) 2\nSCC\n552 (Supra), the same does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. In the said case, the inter-parte earlier judgment\ndeclaring the gift deed invalid was held to be binding on the parties even if\nerroneous and the parties were estopped from challenging the validity of\ngift in the subsequent suit.\n80.    In the present case, the plaintiff nos. 2 to 5 or their father were not\nparty in the previous title suit, but they were added as co-appellants at 1st\nappellate stage by virtue or order passed by the High Court in civil revision.\nFurther, the appellate court's judgment in the previous suit did not even\nrecord a finding that half share of the schedule-A property of the case was\nallotted to Indulal G. Thakkar in partition/family arrangement. The finding\n60\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nwas that consideration was paid by Manikant G. Thakkar to the extent of\nRs. 5,000/- from joint family fund who jointly purchased the property with\nHari Narayan Parikh. The point is whether written statement filed in earlier\nsuit and evidence led therein amounts to admission of partition and\nallocation of suit property to exclusive share of Indulal G. Thakkar. This\nCourt finds that the factum of partition and allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G. Thakkar with respect to the suit property was not the subject\nmatter in the previous suit. Rather the subject matter was as to whether\nManikant G. Thakkar had contributed in payment of consideration amount\nwhile jointly purchasing the property with Hari Narayan Parikh so as to\nclaim half share of the property.\n81.   As already observed above, the legality, validity and admissibility of\nthe document relating to family arrangement (Exhibit 16 in this suit /\nexhibit-C in the previous suit) was not examined in the earlier title suit\nfought between Hari Narayan Parikh and legal heirs and successors of\nManikant G. Thakkar. Admittedly, exhibit 16 is an unregistered document.\n82.   From perusal of Exhibit 16, this Court finds that the same is full of\ncuttings and it is not clear as to who all are signatories to the said document.\nThe said document does not give clear description of the properties and it\nalso refers to future division with respect to certain properties. The perusal\nof the said document also does not reveal that it was in the form of any\nmemorandum of partition. Rather, the family arrangement appears to be\nallocating certain properties to one or the other member of the family.\n83.   Further, the materials on record do not reveal that the so-called\nfamily arrangement was followed by separation amongst the family\nmembers leading to exclusive possession of properties including exclusive\npossession of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property)\nby Indulal G Thakkar and then by the plaintiffs after his death . This court\nis of the considered view that the document Exhibit 16 being unregistered,\nis not admissible in evidence at the first instance and further it suffers from\nlacuna as mentioned above. This Court also finds that nothing has been\nbrought on record to show that Indulal G. Thakkar had ever even acted\npursuant to the so-called family arrangement (Exhibit 16) with respect to\nthe property involved in the present case, inasmuch as, no mutation was\n61\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\never carried out in his name nor he was put in possession, much less in\nexclusive possession of the property involved in this case. The aforesaid\ndiscussion of the oral evidences of the witnesses reveals that it was\nManikant G. Thakkar, who was in possession of the property and after his\ndeath his legal heirs and successors continued to be in possession of the\nproperty and transferred the property to defendant nos. 6 and 7 through\nregistered sale deed and the purchasers (defendant no. 6 and 7) got their\nname mutated in the revenue records. At no point of time Indulal G.\nThakkar came in exclusive possession of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property).\n84.   The plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove through oral and/or\ndocumentary evidence that Indulal G Thakkar and then plaintiffs were ever\nin possession of the property much less, exclusive possession of the\nproperty pursuant to the so-called unregistered family settlement (exhibit-\n16). Admittedly the property was standing in the joint name of Manikant\nG. Thakkar and Hari Narayan Parikh. It has also come in the cross-\nexamination of PW-3 that Manikant G. Thakkar was living separately since\nbeginning and he also had his independent source of income. However, it\nwas held in the earlier suit at appellate stage that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npaid his share of consideration from joint family fund and therefore Hari\nNarayan Parikh was only entitled to half share of present schedule A\nproperty.\n85.   This Court is of the considered view that the point as to whether there\nwas any partition in the family of Thakkars by virtue of Exhibit-C in the\nearlier suit corresponding to Exhibit 16 in the present case, was never in\nissue in the earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G.\nThakkar had contributed in the purchase of the suit property along with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. There is no finding of the 1st appellate court in the appeal\narising out of the earlier suit that there was partition through family\nsettlement and the property at schedule B (half share of schedule A\nproperty) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G Thakkar.\n86.   This Court also finds that the family settlement (Exhibit 16) was\nnever proved by any of the witnesses. Rather, it was simply exhibited and\nplaced on record. Mere exhibiting the document does not amount to proof\n62\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nof the document. This Court also finds that the evidence of Savita M.\nThakkar in the earlier suit was exhibited as exhibit-20 in the present suit,\nwho in her evidence-in-chief in the earlier suit had supported the family\nsettlement as Exhibit 16 and allocation of the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) to Indulal G Thakkar and she had also\ndeposed that she had signed certain blank documents. Her cross-\nexamination in the earlier suit reveals that she was completely unaware\nabout the proceedings and the purpose for which the suit was filed. She has\nalso stated in her cross-examination that some documents were to be filed\nbefore the Income Tax Department. She has stated that her husband,\nManikant G. Thakkar, used to run a canteen in Telco and stated that the\ncanteen could run for a period of six months after the death of her husband;\nshe was not even aware about the contents of the so called family\narrangement. Further in her cross-examination in exhibit-20 , she had also\nstated that whatever she had deposed before the court was according to the\ninstructions given by sons of Indulal G. Thakkar.\n87.   This Court finds that no reliance can be placed on oral evidences led\nin the earlier suit by the wife of Manikant G. Thakkar, namely Sabita M.\nThakkar and her son and also on exhibit 16 to hold that there was a\npartition through family settlement and the property at schedule B (half\nshare of schedule A property) was allotted exclusively to Indulal G Thakkar\nand the statements and the stand taken by Sabita M. Thakkar and her son in\nthe earlier suit cannot be used as an estoppel against them to claim\notherwise as the issue of partition and the allocation of exclusive share to\nIndulal G Thakkar was neither the subject matter of the earlier suit nor\ndecided as discussed above.\n88.   This Court finds that the learned trial court while deciding issue no.\n4 has primarily relied upon the Exhibits 20 and 20/1 which were the\nevidence of Savita M. Thakkar and her son Jayesh M. Thakkar in the earlier\ntitle suit wherein Jayesh M. Thakkar had stated that the suit property was\npurchased from joint family fund and that in the year 1973, there was a\nfamily partition and the property was allocated to Indulal G. Thakkar and\nconsequently Indulal G Thakkar had half share of the property with Hari\nNarayan Parikh. The court has also relied upon the evidence of Savita M.\n63\n2025:JHHC:14099\n\n\n\n\nThakkar, who had also supported the factum of partition and allocation of\nshare to Indulal G. Thakkar in her evidence in the earlier title suit. However,\nthis court finds that cross-examination of Savita M. Thakkar in the earlier\nsuit was not considered by the learned trial court while considering her\nevidence in the present case.\n89.   This Court finds that the learned Trial Court relied upon these two\ndocuments i.e. Exhibits 20 and 20/1 to hold that there was a partition and\nthe property at schedule B (half share of schedule A property) was allocated\nto the share of the father of the plaintiff no. 2 to 5, namely, Indulal G\nThakkar. The learned trial court has not examined the legality, validity and\nadmissibility of the Exhibit 16 nor its legality, validity and admissibility\nwere examined in the previous suit. This Court finds that the written\nstatement filed in this case has explained the circumstances under which\nthe so-called family settlement remained undisputed in the previous suit.\nFurther, the claim of partition and allocation of half share of the present\nschedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was not in issue in\nthe earlier suit and the core issue was as to whether Manikant G Thakkar\nhad contributed in purchase of schedule A property and it was held that he\nhad contributed from the joint family fund. The learned trial court has failed\nto consider these aspects of the matter.\n90.   This court also finds that in the previous suit, there was no such\nfinding that pursuant to partition, the property was allocated to Indulal G.\nThakkar. Rather, the specific finding was that Manikant G. Thakkar had\npurchased the property from joint family fund. This court is also of the\nconsidered view that the claim of partition and allocation of half share of\nthe present schedule A property exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar was\nneither in issue nor decided in the earlier suit and accordingly the evidences\nled in the earlier suit cannot be the basis to hold that the property at schedule\nB (half share of schedule A property) was exclusively allotted to Indulal G\nThakkar in family settlement and therefore the defendant no. 1 to 4 had no\nright to transfer the property to the defendant no. 6 and 7 . Further the\nlearned trial court while deciding the issue no. 4 has not at all considered\nthe other materials placed on record, both oral and documentary which have\nbeen discussed in details as aforesaid.\n64\n2025:JHHC:14099\n91.   Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the finding of the\nlearned trial court that the property involved in this case was subject matter\nof partition through family arrangement and was allocated exclusively to\nIndulal G. Thakkar and consequently the plaintiffs had exclusive right, title\nand interest over the property and accordingly the sale deed executed by the\ndefendant nos. 1 to 4 in favour of defendant nos. 6 and 7 was null and void,\ncannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n92.   This Court is of the considered view that the family arrangement and\nconsequent allocation of the property at schedule B (half share of schedule\nA property) exclusively to Indulal G. Thakkar and the possession of Indulal\nG. Thakkar and thereafter, the possession of the plaintiffs has not been\nproved by oral and documentary evidences placed on record. In such\ncircumstances, the exclusive right, title, interest and possession of the\nplaintiffs with regard to the suit property having not been proved, the sale\ndeed executed by defendant nos. 1 to 4, who are the legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar, cannot be said to be a transfer without\nany right, title, interest and possession. Thus, the point of determination is\nanswered by holding that the defendant nos. 1 to 4 [legal heirs and\nsuccessors of Manikant G. Thakkar] had the right to sell the property at\nschedule B (half share of schedule A property) to the defendant nos. 6 and\n7 vide registered sale deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012.\n93.   Consequently, the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012\nexecuted by defendant no. 5 (the power of attorney holder of defendant nos.\n1 to 4- the legal heirs of late Manikant G. Thakkar) in favour of the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 is held to be valid. The right, title, interest and\npossession of the property covered by the registered sale-deed no. 687 dated\n06.03.2012 is decided in favour of the appellants (defendant no. 6 and 7).\n94.   Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 28.02.2023 (decree\nsigned on 13.03.2023) passed by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division-I,\nChandil in Title Suit No. 13 of 2014, to the extent it declares the registered\nsale-deed no. 687 dated 06.03.2012 as null and void and also directs the\nrecovery of possession covered by the aforesaid sale deed to the plaintiffs,\nis hereby set-aside.\n65\n2025:JHHC:14099\n95.      This appeal filed by defendant no. 6 and 7 is allowed in the aforesaid\n         terms.\n96.      Office to prepare decree.\n97.      Pending interlocutory application is closed.\n98.      Let this judgment be communicated to the learned Court concerned\n         through 'FAX/email'.\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nPankaj\n66",
