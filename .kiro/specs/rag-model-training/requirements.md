# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on training and optimizing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model using the scraped Indian legal case data, while cleaning up the project by removing unnecessary deployment and infrastructure files that are not currently relevant to the core legal AI functionality.

## Glossary

- **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that combines case retrieval with LLM for legal question answering
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB database storing embeddings of legal cases for semantic search
- **Legal Case Data**: Scraped Indian legal cases from Indian Kanoon containing full text, metadata, and citations
- **Embedding Model**: sentence-transformers model used to convert legal text into vector representations
- **Training Process**: Process of loading case data into the vector database and optimizing retrieval performance

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a legal AI system user, I want the RAG model to be trained on the complete scraped Indian legal case dataset, so that I can get accurate and comprehensive legal advice based on Indian precedents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the training process is initiated, THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL load all scraped case data from the complete dataset
2. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL process and embed all legal cases using the sentence-transformers model
3. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL store all embeddings in the ChromaDB vector database with proper metadata
4. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL validate that all cases are successfully indexed and searchable
5. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL provide performance metrics on the training completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all unnecessary deployment and infrastructure files from the project, so that the codebase is clean and focused on the core legal AI functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL identify and remove all AWS deployment related files
2. THE System SHALL identify and remove all Docker related files  
3. THE System SHALL identify and remove any other infrastructure files not related to the core legal AI functionality
4. THE System SHALL preserve all core legal AI functionality files and data
5. THE System SHALL maintain the integrity of the ml_legal_system module and its dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a legal AI system user, I want the RAG system to efficiently retrieve relevant cases for my queries, so that I receive fast and accurate legal responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a legal query is submitted, THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL retrieve relevant cases within 2 seconds
2. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL return the top 5 most relevant cases by default
3. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL include relevance scores for each retrieved case
4. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL provide case metadata including court, date, judges, and citations
5. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL handle queries in natural language format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the trained RAG model works correctly with the Indian legal data, so that I can ensure the system provides accurate legal guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL successfully answer sample legal queries using the trained model
2. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL provide responses with proper citations from Indian legal cases
3. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL demonstrate semantic search capabilities across different legal domains
4. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL maintain consistent performance across multiple test queries
5. THE Legal_RAG_System SHALL generate responses using the configured LLM (Gemini or OpenAI)
